        "body": "Hi all, I've been setting up my obsidian Vault for some time now, after exporting my notes from two other proprietary note apps. While I really like Obsidian, I've had so many sync issues resulting in duplicated or missing data between devices usually. My data is synced to a Synology NAS in between.\n\nI've just recently downloaded Joplin to give it a go. Joplin must have a different architecture with the way its sync's, as, as much as I try, I can't get it to have any of the same issues I regularly see with Obsidian.\n\nWith my limited use of Joplin, its sync from my NAS / Local File Store is spot on and the mobile editing has been a nicer experience. On the other hand Obsidian's feature set, and user base is noticeably larger.\n\nAs I'm fairly new to Joplin, I thought I'd ask the more regular users, why do you preference Joplin over the likes of Obsidian? And, does Joplin receive regular updates and improvements?"

The latter is vastly more complex in ways that don't seem to provide any real benefits (except for the one thing I needed, a kanban view that worked on both desktop and mobile). Joplin was simple and clear, didn't require me to set up a vault (?!?) to write a note, etc. Sync worked fine with few if any problems (more than I can say for Obsidian).\n\nThe community around Obsidian is WAY more active, the plugins are constantly churning out, and the UI is a lot prettier than Joplin. If those things are important to you, then go for Obsidian.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want a simple, straightforward app that makes it easy, clear and effictive to write notes, choose Joplin."

Can you give an example? In Joplin you can nest folders as much as you need though.\n\nBidirectional links in Joplin isn't a core feature as in Obsidian, but with a few plugins I find it mostly more reliable than Obsidian (if maybe less tidy) as, again, Obsidian uses titles (which can change), while Joplin use IDs."

You also have one central place to always be online; The obsidian servers instead of being able to just directly sync over lan. \n\nI’d prefer Joplin and open sync, but my experience just wasn’t 100% slick.  \n\nIf you sync with one of the more reliable methods on joplin and it’s working, great.  \n\nBut personally I had it working for weeks, and then I found it miss something or get confused with 3 devices.

People can choose on their own if they going to self-host or buy ready to used cloud.\n\nFor personal use, WebDAV is more than enough that allows sync notes between devices, but if sharing is important then joplin also has self-hosted server. \n\nI tried many such note taking solutions and should say Joplin is most longest survivor on my devices :) \n\nIf you know SQL, then you can query directly SQLite database (which is backend storage for Joplin) when need complex search, for me it is also a great advantage."

        "body": "When it comes to note-taking apps, everyone has their own preferences. I won’t delve into fancy features or native AI/LLM support; instead, I want to focus on the basics and will primarily compare my experience with the free version of each app. For me, Joplin excels in three key areas that are essential for my needs:\n\n1. **Native E2EE Notes**: I require a note-taking app that allows me to store my notes in an encrypted format natively. Joplin provides this feature natively, ensuring my information remains secure. I can have peace of mind at least until quantum computing becomes mainstream and breaks every encryption known to humanity! Lol.\n\n2. **Third-Party Cloud Storage**: Joplin provides its own proprietary paid cloud storage to users, but at the same time, it allows users to utilize almost any major third-party cloud storage natively. This flexibility gives the user the freedom to choose where the notes are stored. Since it offers E2EE natively, We can use it safely. In contrast, while Obsidian does offer E2EE, it is a paid feature that requires you to use their Obsidian Sync, which is a proprietary cloud service. If you don’t want to pay for Obsidian Sync, you can technically use any cloud storage or Syncthing to sync your notes, as they are just .md files that sit on your computer. However, the lack of native E2EE is a deal breaker. Of course, you can use open-source tools like Cryptomator to encrypt your files, but that adds unnecessary hassle, especially when syncing across devices. You have to ensure that you install that third-party encryption tool everywhere, including on your phones.\n\n3. **FOSS**: While not every great software is FOSS, it’s always good to see transparency and community-driven development. Fortunately, Joplin is one of them.\n\nWhile there are plenty of good things that I believe Obsidian excels at, such as its modern intuitive UI, a good mobile app, and many more features, including:\n\n- **Canvas**: The canvas feature is hands down the best way to visually jot down notes with images. It is also nothing but JSON, making it super lightweight. (Although Obsidian's third-party plugin Excalidraw is even better than the canvas.) Joplin has a similar feature, but it is nowhere near as intuitive as Obsidian's canvas. The good thing is that Obsidian's canvas is open source, so technically, if Joplin wanted to, they could adopt it. However, given that Obsidian and Joplin are built on different technologies, it may not be straightforward for Joplin.\n\n- **Great Plugins**: Obsidian has plugins for nearly every need, while Joplin is slowly catching up. At this moment, Obsidian has the best plugin ecosystem.\n\nAnother contrast to my required features in Obsidian is the ability to store each note locally in original .md format, instead of a proprietary file format. This is very helpful for easy backups, especially via GitHub. Unfortunately, as much as I love this feature, I can’t use it because of the nature of this method, which does not work with encryption.\n\nIn summary, Joplin excels in areas that matter most to users who prioritize security, flexibility, and open-source software. Its native end-to-end encryption (E2EE) ensures that your notes remain secure, while the ability to use third-party cloud storage provides flexibility in how you manage your data. Joplin is an excellent choice for those who value privacy and simplicity in their note-taking experience.\n\nOn the other hand, while Obsidian does offer E2EE, it is behind a paywall. However, the free version of Obsidian is still packed with features and shines with its intuitive UI/UX, canvas feature, and extensive plugin ecosystem, making it ideal for users who enjoy visual note-taking and customization. If you’re looking for advanced features and a more dynamic note-taking environment, Obsidian may be the better fit.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this\n\nEdit 1: \n\n@Active-Teach6311 has rightly highlighted a point in my post regarding E2EE that I believe could be misinterpreted by others.\n\nWhen I said, \"Joplin provides E2EE feature natively, ensuring my information remains secure,\" I meant that the exported (backed-up) data from Joplin is encrypted. However, the active directory of Joplin itself is not encrypted. This is a standard practice in many applications, as the active directory often needs to be accessible for real-time syncing and functionality. While the exported data is protected."

Can't link notes inline and no backlinks without 3rd party plugins. **EDIT: The latest version added inline creation of note links via alt + shift + l shortcut!**... still no backlinks though\n- Slow launch and RAM hog\n\n\nObsidian feels a lot slicker/polished, but I'm kind of leaning towards Joplin. Joplin works well enough \"out of the box\" for me, whereas with obsidian felt unusable to me without a bunch of plugins."

It’s been totally worth it. It hasn’t skipped a beat. I like the way the company treats its customers and I’m careful not to get locked in. \n\nI had sync problems with Joplin when using syncthing too. That’s not Joplin’s fault. \nI think Joplin can work better with other ways to sync , such as next cloud.  However, I found setting up NextCloud a bit of an annoyance. I put it on a VPS server because I thought that would be more available than running it at home, but then you’re running everything DIY and I just lost my patience. Hence paying for Obsidian sync. \n\nIt’s no bother though. I actually use my vault for other things. Obsidian sync will sync other things really well too. If you go over the allowance, that’s where you could use Syncthing. You can still use Logseq on your vault at the same time and run scripts on it too. Plus Reor AI. \n\nThis is all very good vibes from Obsidian. I find this very attractive to allow such things. It’s so shortsighted to go with a more closed vault system and miss out on all this. "

My question is: “Why would Dropbox be so unusually slow with its sync?” My syncs on my tablet using Joplin Cloud, but even with Dropbox earlier, are about 10 seconds. Even with Dropbox, they were under 1 minute. But huge amounts of data, or turning off the device  before syncing is done, or very weak devices (Eink Android readers for example), can take a long time.\n\n  \nI was rather interested in problem-solving the issue and learning more about its cause."

I mostly due a lot a web clipping and tagging for person knowledge base.  I am pretty happy with the with functionality (except for the poor interaction between that Vivaldi, but might be Vivaldi's fault, and I digress).     What Joplin add-ons or functionality should I be looking at in 2025.   I have about 14K notes.   And I mostly use the Windows client.\n\nMy current biggest nit-picks with Joplin are:\n\n1. I run multiple screens.   I can't pop-out a note into it's own window and move it to another screen.\n2. Coloring text is a lot of clicks\n3. I tag a lot of content.  I have well more 200 tags.   The tag list is really long.  There is no multi-select.   Say a note is tagged \"Best Of 2024\" and \"TV Shows\".   You can select Best of 2024 or TV Shows.   And you can't use tags to filter search results either. \n\nThx."

You can achieve it with [search filters](https://joplinapp.org/help/apps/search/) though. For example, to see all notes with both the \"bills\" and \"health\" tag: `tag:bills tag:health`"

Is Joplin suitable for journal writing? Are there any features or plugins that enhance the experience?\n2. Here’s what I’ve done so far:\n   * Downloaded the Windows application\n   * Set up synchronization with OneDrive\n   * Enabled encryption with a Master Key\n   * Exported my journals from Notesnook in TXT format and imported them into Joplin\n   * Installed the Android app, synced with OneDrive, and added my master key for decryption\n3. My main goal is to use Joplin daily for journaling. I will be writing in Devanagari script. Does Joplin handle it well in terms of font rendering and search functionality?\n4. I want to ensure that even if I lose all my devices or uninstall Joplin from all of my existing devices, I can install Joplin on a new device, sync with OneDrive, and regain access to all my journals. Would this setup work reliably for that purpose?\n\nLooking forward to your insights. Thanks in advance!"

Unlike OneNote that is based on what is in the cloud, Joplin considers what is on your device as the authority. Syncing is not the same as backing up and shouldn't be treated as such.\n\nBut you might get higher quality answers on the official forum."
