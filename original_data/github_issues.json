I'm all for using non-Google products, but in practice many apps aren't in F-Droid so it means one would also have to use Google Play anyway, so in that case why not use Google Play only?\r\n\r\nWell…\r\n\r\n1. Some apps aren't on Google Play as well because Google is still a company that may enforce censorship to ensure it's profits are secured. See [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) for example. It allows to to play YouTube videos in the background and download them in different formats as well. So it's basically a _free_ competitor of Spotify / Youtube Red on top of YouTube. Similar things happened on the Apple AppStore but but as iOS devices can't use F-Droid natively this might be another issue.\r\n2. [Some countries block Google services including Google Play](https://www.quora.com/Is-Google-play-banned-in-any-country). F-Droid is usually not blocked and even if it _would_ be blocked you could run _your own_ mirror to provide packages for your friends or even share these packages _within the F-Droid application_.\r\n3. Your comment `in practice many apps aren't in F-Droid` itself is a reason why it is more or less lucrative for other application maintainers to publish on F-Droid. See, if every maintainer would think like this there wouldn't be _any applications_ on F-Droid at all. Luckily more and more people put their apps on F-Droid. So if Joplin appears on F-Droid it might be another small part to convince other maintainers and therefore help step by step increasing the amount of available apps on F-Droid.\r\n4. Some applications use analytics provider that aren't trustworthy and even considered spyware. Often the maintainers don't even know about it, as the analytics logic in proprietary components can change their behaviour. A service could be trustworthy today but starts spying on your users tomorrow. It isn't possible to _generally_ avoid spyware or software flaws that may lead to spyware behaviour, but you can at least ensure that there aren't any proprietary components that would make it difficult to detect bad behaviour. F-Droid ensures that no proprietary components are included. For end users this means F-Droid applications are usually more trustworthy. It's no guarantee but at least a useful hint.\r\n5. Finally, I know indeed people who absolutely simply avoid the Google Play Store by choice.\r\n\r\nSo it like comparing the apple app store and homebrew."

So when I've added it I've only enabled this particular functionality and I disabled all the features to \"help Google improve Firebase\" (there were several checkboxes for it). This is complex technology and I can't claim I understand everything of it but as far as I know this doesn't introduce any tracking. If I'm wrong, I'm happy to work with anybody who knows about it and provide an option that disables that functionality.\r\n\r\nThe reason I've used Firebase is because there's currently no good local notification package for React Native on Android (on iOS this is covered by the built-in iOS lib). The only independent Android one is discontinued and there's no alternative. Basically it's not like search engines - either Google or Duckduckgo - it's Google or nothing at the moment. When a good open source module is released it's always possible to switch to it (like many things in Joplin, the Alarm driver for android is tiny so can be switched easily)."

So this means you are not using Firebase at all ? I saw in the history log there that once you used but not anymore. Is that correct? In that case you are in theory (as of Firebase) ready for F-Droid, aren't you?\r\n\r\nBeing on F-Droid is crucial, a lot of people are getting rid of Google completely, for security reasons, and for ethical reasons, they do not want to be tracked and used for publicity. Moreover Google's Firebase is not free as in free beer software, this means we know nothing about it, what's the purpose of doing open source software if it depends on non-free stuff? But I know that this is not easy, especially in Android, we are sooooo little independent there, that is why when we can, we should first be on F-Droid:)  F-Droid is important and it is important that F-Droid stays very demanding about stuff we link our software with :) so thanks for the work again, and hope you find time digging into this very important issue."

So I must stand corrected: He's not including _everything_ but he's following [a _very_ simple policy](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/info#how_enter) (i.e. must have a description, file size should be small, some code + apk is available, end-user focused). And even he's preferring the F-Droid repository.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _official_, F-Droid repository [exclusively includes FOSS applications](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Inclusion_Policy/).\r\n\r\nSo if someone is asking for availability within an \"Android FOSS-App-Store\", IzzySoft's repo can obviously not be the answer.\r\nIt just provides easier access/updates for applications that didn't make it to the official F-Droid repositories (yet)."

And if you wonder: Yes, on occasion I even kicked out apps I initially included when I found they do not meet those criteria (or stopped updating if newer versions did; sometimes I was able to convince the devs to revert those changes and could pick up updates again later; yes, I have a \"warning system\" in place to notify me in such cases, it's not perfect but certainly good). So with my repo you are definitely safer than picking APKs from \"random websites\" :wink:\r\n\r\nBut as pointed out: I'm with you on the fact my repo isn't \"strictly FOSS\": even if the entire code of an app is open source, as soon as some \"proprietary component\" (like Analytics or some other GApps part) is included, I cannot (and do not) claim the app is still FOSS.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** While I happily keep *Joplin* in my repo, I'd definitely welcome if it went \"fully FOSS\" (or at least offered a FOSS flavor) so it could be moved to f-droid.org – which for sure is the \"more trustworthy\" place."

With auto-update being disabled, it's now a bit more tricky for F-Droid.org (one of the reasons I strongly suggested to establish it before), but should be doable as well – we might just ping the packager who got the build working in the first place, once there's a new tag with Fastlane."

There are several apps which are in both repos for one reason or the other (slightly different build, betas with mine but stables with fdroid, just for faster updates as F-Droid cannot keep up with the release frequency of FairEmail …).\r\n\r\n> Also if you remove it, I think people will have to uninstall Joplin and reinstall it from F-Droid, is that correct?\r\n\r\nYes, users who had it installed from my repo would then either have to do that, or revert to Play (ugh…). So if there are any settings, an export/import feature would make such a transition easy.\r\n\r\nSo if you wish it to stay, just say so and I set that in the config here.

That it can lag significantly behind the official release which can be a big issue when a timely update is needed. Also less secure because the app might be left with a known security vulnerability for several days, even if the official app has been patched. And it should also say that certain features are removed such as the camera support.\r\n\r\n- All links to official Joplin support channel should be removed, and replaced by links to F-Droid own channels.

To answer the question on the issue:\r\n\r\n> where can see what is failing?\r\n\r\nYou'd need to get the latest desktop version, enable E2EE and sync. Then sync with the latest F-Droid version - the app will not be able to decrypt the notes of the desktop version.\r\n\r\n> Not sure I follow, the description [says as much](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.cozic.joplin/) right?\r\n\r\nYes I see it now, thank you. Can we provide more details? For example: \r\n\r\n *This release can lag significantly behind the official release which can be an issue when a timely update is needed. It may be less secure because the app might have a known security vulnerability for several days, even if the official app has been patched. It does not have camera capabilities. Issues with this version might be raised on https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata for user @muelli\"*\r\n\r\nI realise that doesn't look good and might dissuade users from installing the app, but I think they should be fully aware of the risks. Also when they get stuck, like now, they can't even install the official APK on top since you use a different signature. So it's a trade off - a fully FOSS app but with various associated risks, and users should know about them."

Also, with Google Play it is difficult to keep your phone clean of non-free software, because it is very difficult to distinguish in the Google Play store what license each package has."

My repo has not the same prestige, purity etc. as F-Droid has, but comes quite close. The APKs it serves are the ones signed by the resp. developers, so usually you can cross-update from an install you've made in the past via Play/Aurora.\r\n\r\nThat said, there's another minor difference between the Joplin versions from F-Droid and from my repo: the one in F-Droid is the \"pure F/LOSS\" variant, while the one in mine comes with so-called Anti-Features, as Laurent includes some proprietary libraries for additional features. You should keep that in mind to – as e.g. MLKit brings in some Google-ties again, which you won't have with the F-Droid builds.\r\n\r\nThat said you see that at least concerning transparency, I'm fully with F-Droid.

I think you may be comparing it to cloud-based apps that do all the work on Google or MIcrosoft servers. Then it can be 20-30MB. We mostly don't do that - voice recognition is offline, OCR is offline, etc. and that means we need to bundle this with the app (we also try to move some of it to optional plugins).\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm not sure this is a big problem. Phones storage keeps increasing and hopefully we can make use of this space to offer new features.

It makes much more sense to be able to tag a note with multiple tags (versus only being able to put it in one notebook). The topic of a note might overlap with multiple topics, and if you are forced into organizing by notebook you can have a really hard time deciding which notebook to put something in. And when you try to find the note 6 months later and you can't remember what you filed it under it becomes frustrating. Tags, on the other hand, make much more sense.\r\n\r\nI mean, gmail ditched folders for tags and it has been hugely successful."

Notebooks work good as currently intended, and provide a rigid structure to save the notes in.

        "body": "> while tags describe the status of that content inside that container.\r\n\r\nThat's not the way I envision using tags, personally. Tags, to me, are not a status indicator but rather a topic - basically the same way gmail uses tags. EVERYTHING goes into one 'folder' (all mail) and everything else is just a tag. For example, gmail does not have an actual inbox, it's just items that have the 'inbox' tag.\r\n\r\nNow, it's an easy fix (as in easily described, not necessarily easily coded), if you want to use notebooks you can still use them. If you don't want to use notebooks, just put everything into one 'master' notebook.\r\n\r\nPersonally, if nested tags were an option I would not use the notebook feature at all. Everything would get dumped into one master notebook and I would only use tags. Organizing information into discrete notebooks makes no senses to me. An individual note may fit into multiple 'categories' and currently notebooks do not allow you to have the note in multiple notebooks (I guess you could make duplicates technically?). Imagine you had to go to an extensive training program for work. Would you put it in the work notebook? Training notebook? Or what about a note that has code snippits for various work and personal projects? Does that go into the coding folder? Or the work folder? Or the home folder? All of these are easily fixed by forgetting about folders/notebooks and just tag everything.\r\n\r\nAgain, all that being said - you don't have to actually get rid of notebooks, just don't use them. But honestly, I don't see the point in using notebooks when tags solve a whole bunch of problems and don't introduce any issues. You can functionally use tags exactly like notebooks anyway."

It is not straightforward as you may think: you need to check for duplicate notes down in a hierarchy in order to count the number of notes for any upper-level tag otherwise you may count the same note multiple times. Though I think the initial version of this PR did not have such issue; it was introduced during the discussion as there were some changes requested by the maintainers---specifically I was asked not to use SQL views for maintaining the counts (although they were significantly more efficient), since they wanted to move away from any SQL-dialect specific code. That being said I think it should be possible to make it work efficiently with some clever tree algorithms. There is some more discussion in https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3559, where I've outlined some of the considerations that must be made and possible resolutions to this issue, which I hope may be helpful to anyone who takes it up."

That being said I have not looked deeply into the code base for now, but I would be interested, because maybe it would make sense to introduce some more basic changes to how the data is handled first to then implement some more efficient algorithm/methods for this issue here?\r\n\r\nAs in: the upper-level tag or in general each tag should be made aware of it's child-tags and which notes (nodes) it contains. Moving from tag to tag (retagging) could then be handled by a `tag processor` that is handing over the UUID/ULID the the other entity."

        "body": "I'm a big fan of the way [Hydrus](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus) handles tags for its image database. Each image, in addition to having normal tags, can have hierarchical tags added. For example, if I set up \"painting\" to be a child tag of \"art\". Whenever I add \"painting\" to an image, it automatically also adds \"art\", saving me the trouble of adding both each time I want to tag an image. When \"painting\" is removed, it also removes \"art\".\r\n\r\nMy favorite part of all is how easy it is to create a search for some logical AND/OR/NOT combination of tags. I like @miciasto's idea for dynamic notebooks, which would be equivalent to a search page in Hydrus. I would find it very useful to have a to-do system centered around notebooks that contain notes matching specific criteria.\r\n\r\nBy default, tags are displayed in order of how frequently they occur. Right-clicking a tag opens a context menu that allows the user to quickly add to the current search instead of needing to type in the search bar and modify some kind of formatted search string. When a search is performed, the tag list updates to display only those tags applied to the images in the current search.\r\n\r\nI would love it if some of these tagging features came to Joplin. I'm sharing this because I hope that the Joplin devs might be able to take some inspiration from Hydrus's code to help implement this feature."

Was really looking forward to ditch windows and how keeping software up to date there took so much time (**EDIT**: I'm not after automatic updates, what I mean is that finding out and installing new versions of software started to be a burden, Vs. what I thought that in linux world a user has this one update manager that checks and notifies of new versions and keeps everything up-to-date). It seems that fragmentation is a core thing in linux world.. everybody is free to do what they want and there's always lots of people that want different things.

Alternatively, how much benefit does it have to the users? Flatpak has proved itself reliable for Joplin, and overtime, AppImage increasingly less so.\r\n\r\nWhilst I can understanding only wanting one distribution officially, in 2024, is AppImage providing any advantages consider the zero sandboxing, out of date library demands (libfuse2), incomplete library bundles (AppImages make a lot of assumptions on what libraries the system already has), no package signing, inferior desktop integration, etc.\r\n\r\nFlatpak becomes both the OS and the installation format.

It doesn't include libpulse0 or libpipewire, as a result, on WSL2, your app doesn't play audio. An audioplayer, it's main purpose.

        "body": ">The package was trying to use GTK2 because the packager put GTK2 code in it, not the user on a system that doesn't have GTK2 installed. The result is if someone installs GIMP which is still GTK2, suddenly you've got users on an entirely different codebranch on that's nearly 15 years unmaintained, and the association between cause and effect is less than obvious. The app recovers and works well, so I can see why it isn't a practical issue; but have you tested your app with Gimp installed?\r\n\r\nDeaDBeeF ships plugins in both GTK2 and GTK3 versions, and since only the GTK3 libs were bundled, the GTK2 plugins still try to find GTK2 libraries. \r\n\r\nNote that this is intended, the appimage is based of the portable build of deadbeef, where the user may or may not have GTK2 or GTK3, this is why it  ships the plugins in both versions. Worst that could happen is that the GTK2 plugin loads libraries from the host and that causes the app to crash somehow, I just made sure to delete them.\r\n\r\n> It doesn't include libpulse0 or libpipewire,\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67609c8c-fb43-4355-8658-4692b070c77c)\r\n\r\nAnd I tested sound on the voidlinux musl vm and it worked.\r\n\r\nOn deadbeef you have to select the output device and plugin in the settings, but if you are sure sound isn't working on WSL then you actually found a bug.\r\n\r\n>when the results so far show that actually you've still forgotten some stuff that wouldn't have been missed if you were a Flatpak and even introduced problems by supporting more packages than you need to, ironically proving some of the advantages of Flatpak for users and developers.\r\n\r\n[1](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/3332) [2](https://github.com/flathub/org.audacityteam.Audacity/issues/90)\r\n\r\nSeems they never figured out why that bug happened, but given that it gets fixed when access to pipewire was removed hints that either the flatpak or the runtime was missing something, the bug also only manifested on certain versions of Linux Mint and Pop!_OS which just makes more likely that something was missing. \r\n\r\nThe argument you made reminds me of the people that say that rust is better when there is a bug on another programming language, Nothing will protect you from logic errors and stuff like forgetting that the app I ship has a fallback to use GTK2 is just normal and only manifested as some error messages. In any case the AppImage ships everything it needs to actually run on any linux system as shown by the screenshot I shared on a musl system **where it is impossible for the app to be using the host libraries.**\r\n\r\nAnyways, sorry for the spam, this all started because the bunch of false information you said about appimages, if you are still certain that sound doesn't work on WSL after making sure the right output device was selected then please open an issue at the repo and I will take a deeper look. \r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEDIT:  btw I'm on a openSUSE vm since I'm testing an unrelated thing so I just downloaded the appimage and **sounds works** once again, [and I can confirm that the GTK3 theming is being followed even though the appimage bundles its own glibc and gtk](https://imgur.com/a/99tSHit)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Launching joplin doesn't do anything visible, but it spawns 4 joplin.exe processes in the background. Launching it again opens an empty window, with basic, but also empty menu (File-Exit, and so on, nothing actionable). This window is not possible to close (titlebar button UI doesn't react), it has to be force closed with task manager.\r\n\r\nI tried portable version. Launching exe causes 4 joplin.exe process to show up plus joplinportable.exe and again, no window. Launching it again, shows second joplinportable.exe and empty window as shown above, that again is not possible to close by usual means.\r\n\r\nThere is no error messages or anything suggesting what to do. Computer was restarted after joplin installation.\r\n\r\nLinux version works like a charm, but Windows counterpart failed a big time :(. Without full multi-system support, the whole app usage is in question. There is no browser access to my notes so basically I have no notes at work."

During installation, in the last step I chose \"Run Joplin\" and nothing happened. As before, joplin processes are visible in task manager, no window shows up. Second launch triggers the empty window.

I checked the path and it seems to be OK. The major problem is that somehow, it cannot read C:\\Users\\michal\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Joplin\\resources\\app.asar although the file app.asar that weights 261,8MB is there. Or maybe this file is incomplete? I cannot check this because I have no access to the inside of this file. 7zip can't unpack it.\r\n\r\nThere is however a folder app.asar.unpacked. Hmmm... Let's look on the structure.\r\n\r\nThis is OK: C:\\Users\\michal\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Joplin\\resources\\app.asar\\node_modules\\@joplin\\lib\\node_modules\\\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no \\sqlite3\\lib\\binding\\napi-v3-win32-ia32\\node_sqlite3.node\r\n\r\nInside app.asar\\node_modules\\@joplin\\lib\\node_modules\\ there is only \\node-notifier\\ instead \\sqlite3\\\r\n\r\nSo if the folder app.asar.unpacked is a faithful representation of the app.asar file, the paths of file structure is wrong.

Of course this could be a coincidental change and some other thing may be at fault here.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Yes, I think it's one of the tools used to build Joplin; haven't managed to find which one exactly.\r\n\r\nAt least you know now that the offending tool changed or was added between 1.3.18 and 1.4.12\r\n\r\nAnyway, I can finally can have working Joplin at work and that solves the biggest issue for me. Of course this is a workaround and the issue is still there, but at least we know more now.\r\n\r\nIf needed, I could test pre-releases and then find out which one introduced this breakage. Let me know.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It turned out that Clipper isn't cooperating with the old version of Joplin... so it would be great to have the newest, working version."

In that case, maybe it means that Electron builder is not unpacking certain native files as it should for 32-bit.\r\n\r\nOr it's because these two files are under `@joplin/lib` and thus are not packed correctly. For Sharp and Keytar (both native modules) I pack them with the app because there were problems when there were under `@joplin/lib`. So Sqlite3 and node-notifier should probably be moved out of `@joplin/lib` too, that would be the logical thing to do anyway, but I've never done it because it works fine on 64-bit."

Joplin builds sqlite3 using `electron-rebuild`\r\n2. sqlite expects `napi_build_version` variable to be set and uses it for the output file name, see https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/blob/593c9d498be2510d286349134537e3bf89401c4a/package.json#L10-L18\r\n3. `napi_build_version` should be set by nodejs; the change to expose it was backported to node v10 in `10.23.0`: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35266\r\n4. When building sqlite3 from it's repo all works fine. However `electron-rebuild` seems to be using its own nodejs headers (downloaded from https://www.electronjs.org/headers/v10.1.6/node-v10.1.6-headers.tar.gz) and for some reason the required variable is not set there even though the node version in these headers is > `10.23.0` (`12.16.3` to be precise)\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking to see what's wrong with the headers but so far I can suggest 2 ways of fixing it:\r\n* Try newer Electron, 11 for example.\r\n* Patch sqlite's `package.json` to replace `napi_build_version` with the actual value, which is `3`"

Screenshots and detailed steps of what you're trying to do will probably be helpful here.\r\n\r\nAre you trying to modify `JoplinPortable.exe` by any chance? That's not going to work (without re-building the whole portable package). The steps explained previously in this thread can only be applied to the normal Joplin installation. Alternatively, you can still unpack the portable package, then unpack `app-32.7z`, then modify the asar archive there without installing Joplin, but the end result won't be portable anymore."

I thought it had to be edited prior to installation.

Wow, did I just say I can't wait to get back to work.... oops, maybe that wasn't right to say ;) But I am excited to get Joplin working on my Windows laptop. I am absolutely loving it so far on my iMac Pro and my Samsung Galaxy A32 phone. It is taking me a little while to get used to it after using Evernote for the past few years (and fixing the formatting after importing all my notes), but so far I really like it and once I'm certain that it will work for all of my note taking needs, I'm going to be ditching Evernote completely and donating at least something to the Joplin dev team so that apps like this can still exist. I can not stand the subscription model that everyone wants to go to, but I do understand why they do it. I'm just glad that programs like Joplin also exist! There are more than a few other great apps/plugins like this that I'm happy to donate to as well and grateful that they exist ([Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io), [gotmls](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gotmls/) and [mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html) are all great ones for example).

Let's say you are in the middle of a long note and switch to a different note. After switching back, the position is shown correctly. You use `tab` to go to the editor. However, you can't see the cursor and as soon as you start typing the position scrolls to the top of the note. (Which also means you lost the cursor position.)\r\n\r\n"

When coming back to Joplin to continue editing the note the user has to scroll back rediously to the last cursor position.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\nI think a preference option would be very useful to let the user switch between the following options when switching to edit mode:\r\n\r\n-set cursor to the top\r\n-set cursor to the bottom\r\n-set cursor to the top line shown in viewing mode when edit button was pressed\r\n-set cursor to the last position when the note was in editing mode\r\n\r\nFor this to work, in the metadata the note should preserve its last editing cursor position.\r\n\r\nWith these choices most requirements should be met.\r\n"

        "body": "Ok, so I was wondering about my sanity, forgetting to click on an option somewhere and getting as 'default' behaviour 'always jump to top', because, well, _all editors I use will jump to the last position instead_. Oh... with the exception perhaps of WordPress... which uses... TinyMCE!\r\n\r\nHmmm. I'm starting to see a pattern here... 🤔🧐\r\n\r\nActually, to be more precise, in Joplin, the page doesn't simply 'jump to the top'. It _visually_ does so, _but the cursor is not even inside the text area_ (this is true on the visual editor and on the Markdown editor). In other words, to get to the end of a note, you have to _click_ on the note and _then_ scroll to the bottom. Two steps!... for something that 'comes out of the box' on pretty much everything out there used for editing.\r\n\r\nI guess that the developers have been _mostly_ using less-than-a-page notes, where this 'automatically moving to the last position' is not really an issue.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I use the visual editor most — but occasionally switch to Markdown (this is especially true when wanting to add some Markdown that isn't on a comfortably-placed button on the visual editor's toolbar). Nothing can be more annoying than editing something somewhere on the middle of a 20-page document, switching to a different editor... and being placed at the top... patiently scrolling down until I find where I had been... do the changes... switching back to the visual editor and ***gaaaah*** the cursor is now at the top again!\r\n\r\nI'm a great fan of the [Principle of Least Surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). While naturally enough each application has its quirks and no two applications will ever work in _exactly the same way_ (much less if running under different operating systems), over the decades of GUI development, we have slowly moved towards _some_ expected behaviour across applications. For example, _most_ people expect that when you scroll _down_ a text (via a slider, a gesture, whatever), the page does _not_ scroll _up_ instead, just because the developer thinks that it makes more sense that way. Instead, such a reversal of an 'obvious' UI/UX experience is relegated to an _option_ instead. In most OSes, for instance, you _can_ configure your mouse/trackpad/gesture so that it works in the _opposite_ way than the 'standard': a typical example is, say, flight simulators, where pressing 'down' actually moves the plane/spaceship 'up' (mostly because that's how it works with joysticks on 'real' plane cockpits). But most games (I'm thinking of one from the late 1980s...) will have an option to reverse the keys, for those who couldn't care less about how 'real' planes actually work, and just prefers to stick to the Principle of Least Surprise.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: I understand that for _some_ people, having notes starting _always_ at the top makes more sense to them. A good use case is keeping track of a changelog, where traditionally newer things come before old ones; another scenario is sticking to _very short notes_ where the issue of scrolling up/down is not really very important. I'm fine with those exceptions, but they ought to be treated as such: _exceptions_. _Most_ people will want their documents to be opened in a _predictable_ position, and this is _usually_ the _last_ position they were at. I'd be fine with an 'always on the bottom' choice as an alternative to 'remembering' the last position (and even syncing it across devices!). I'd still grumble about 'losing' the position when inevitably I'd switch from one note to another, to quickly check something up, return to the original note... only to find that the cursor is not where I expected it to be. Ouch!\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to Joplin (trying to get rid of Agenda, Notes and Stickies on my Mac...) and I'm aware of a few workarounds. One would be to drop an anchor and then just jump to it. I would only need to remember to drop anchors all the time (and delete the old ones). Possibly a plugin could do that automatically for me. Because the anchor is part of the document, it would be easily synced across devices; and with some clever CSS styling, it _might_ even be possible to avoid having those anchors visible or even printable (or exportable). However, I also think that it's better to have the cursor position as metadata, and even if it's not synced between devices, it's better than nothing... which is what we have now.\r\n\r\nI'm actually quite surprised that so few people in the past 2-3 years have complained about the lack of this feature! 😯"

        "body": "When syncing to the file system, new files with a timestamp older than the last sync timestamp get silently ignored (instead of being pulled into Joplin).\r\n\r\nThis situation arises for me because I run Joplin on my PC and phone, have them both sync to the filesystem and then use [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync the two. syncthing maintains file last-modified metadata across devices, meaning that if my mobile device is not busy syncing (could be that syncing is off, I'm out of network range, off wifi, etc) and I add a note, wait a day and then let it sync, then the file on my PC will have a creation date of right now and a last-modified date that is a day in the past. Joplin ignores it.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nJoplin version: 2.7.15 (Although this has been happening for at least a year, I updated recently and I *think* I was on 2.3.6 before that)\r\nPlatform: Desktop, Windows 10 x64 21H2/19044\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set joplin to sync to the filesystem and ensure it is all synced up.\r\n2. Close Joplin\r\n3. Create a new note file (I copied an existing one and changed the name & ID in the file to a new hash)\r\n4. Set the file's last-modified time to before your last Joplin sync\r\n    * e.g in powershell: `(Get-Item \"c6989cfc4d4d9114591431119fe5e8a5.md\").LastWriteTime=(\"15 May 2022 19:38:00\")`\r\n5. Open Joplin & sync\r\n6. See that it does not pull in the new file\r\n\r\n## Thoughts following my own short investigation into the synchronisation code\r\n\r\nI've looked through the sync code in Joplin and I see it is relying entirely on the last-modified time of the file. In particular it will ignore any file with a timestamp older than Joplin's last sync time *even if the file is unknown to Joplin*. It seems to me that Joplin should instead read in new files even if they're older than the last sync time but there may well be other factors that I'm not aware of. I know little about the filesystem format but at the very least Joplin would need to check the contents of each new file to know what its reading in (my local instance has 200 notes but >500 files, some of which appear to be recordings of edits? Presumably these contains data from tables in the sqlite DB other than the \"notes\" table?)\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the same problem can happen with file edits. This is more difficult to resolve since you can't use the existence of the file as proof that a sync is needed. In that case, you might be able to use the file-specific sync time (in the sync_items table, assuming that actually contains what the name suggests) to do a somewhat better job, but short of hashing the file contents (which would be very robust but also far slower than checking file times and obviously problematic on all of the non-filesystem sync targets, possibly worth doing only for the filesystem sync target?) I'm not sure there's a great solution for that case. If the conclusion is that this behaviour is a problem then maybe solving the new-file case is at least a good start?\r\n\r\nI can see about changing my non-joplin file-sync setup so that the file timestamps are updated when the file syncs (which would prevent this issue from happening to me in the first place) but that might not be as easy as one might hope and would only solve the problem with my particular setup (other file-system setups may run into the same issue).\r\n\r\nThis could possibly be the related to #5099 and #6346\r\n"

Joplin ignores it.\r\n\r\nI've experienced the exact same problem, also when using Syncthing. In my case, I believe this usually happens when Joplin performs synchronisation while Syncthing is still downloading the files, which results in a partial Joplin sync. Then, when trying to sync again, Joplin doesn't detect the notes that have been downloaded in between. I wasn't sure what the problem was about exactly though. Thank you so much for finding the actual culprit.\r\n\r\nIs there any workaround that you'd suggest to do at the user's side as a temporary solution? Other than disabling automatic sync completely and relying on manual sync only, of course 😉. When encountering the error myself, I've up to now relied on the \"delete local data and re-download from sync target\" button, but this requires a manual action, while I'd prefer to rely on an automated solution here.\r\n\r\nI think https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/sync-issues-using-filesystem-sync-and-sync-tool/2652 from 3 years ago (!) talks about the same issue. It mentions touching all files in order to update their timestamps as a possible workaround. Is there any danger in doing just that (e.g. with a periodically run script)?\r\n\r\n**Edit 1:**\r\n\r\nI performed the whole touch thing, and after that Joplin was able to discover a dozen items that had been missing, which I wasn't even aware of… I haven't observed any peculiarities after doing it. However, I must mention that the process is slow, especially on low-end hardware and mobile devices, depending on the number of notes.\r\n\r\nJust to be thorough, and also because people in that forum thread were asking about how to do touch in Windows, the actual command is `copy /b file.md+` (or `for /f %a in ('dir /b *.md') do copy /b %a+` to process all the md files).\r\n\r\n**Edit 2:**\r\n\r\nI think a possible workaround could to be sync the folder in Syncthing to a different path first, and then use some kind of a background script that would make sure that the folder has been synced completely (e.g. if no changes have happened in the last x minutes), and only then copy that folder in a single pass to yet another folder that would be used strictly as the sync target for Joplin. Doing so would eliminate the partial sync issue. Obviously, this is possible only on the desktop, and not with the mobile versions of Joplin, which likely suffer from the same problem. Also, it wouldn't be perfect either, as the synchronisation in Syncthing can still be interrupted, e.g. by a disconnect, and then the sync state will end up being incomplete anyway.\r\n\r\n**Edit 3:**\r\n\r\nI think I've managed to hack up a PowerShell script that \"touches\" only newly added files, while skipping everything else.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path *.md | Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -le (Get-Date)} | ForEach-Object {$_.LastWriteTime = (Get-Date).AddYears(1)}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script checks the modified time of all notes whether it's equal or older than the current moment, and then, if the condition matches, it updates it to 1 year from now. On the first run, this forces Joplin to rescan all notes, but later on, it only makes it rescan new/modified notes, while skipping those that have had their date modified already.\r\n\r\nI think the date can be set even further into the future, so that even once the 1-year period has passed, Joplin will still not be forced to go through those notes, but the value of \"1\" year just seemed like a safe bet."

Take any file on your Windows PC (same thing on Linux as far as I could check) and copy-paste it to another folder. The creation date is right now, but the modification date is whatever the modification date of the original file was (which could be years ago).\n\nThis was already identified by the OP as the root of the problem 3 years ago. You can't ignore files with old modification dates because it's totally possible to have a \"new\" file with an old modification date."

It tracks actual file modifications instead to determine which version is newer, older, or same.\n\nI think this might be wrong according to [the Syncthing docs](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/syncing.html#scanning)?\n\n> During a rescan (regardless whether full or from watcher) the existing files are checked for changes to their **modification time**, size or permission bits.\n\nBut anyways, I think Syncthing in this case is not the culprit, but Joplin by ignoring files."

Here is an [example](https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpVkMFOwzAQRH_F2hNI6Q_kgERT6CUIJHoi7mFJNrXV2GvZDlWV5N-xG5Bgj_NmdlczQcsdQQknj06Jw05akeaxqZTXIRoMR7HZPMx7isKwpesstnd7FkGxc9qe7lf_NptENdXZRiIqbc_Liqpb_tXSLHZNjS6yO_4lhwvP4qnRbyqt_0-Up5R6bnose9y06EWF_ggFGPIGdZfennJAQqB29Dpea_qiQUKZpIE5kIRiNfQDX1qFPmY4rVckqGiGGj9pCFmOfqRMlp9MVGRoXdahP0uQdknHcYz8frUtlDlQwOg6jLTTmCo0vyJ1OrJ_Wbu9VVyAQ_vBnCw9DoGWbzR0eq4) in the Live Editor. On the other side I haven't changed the Joplin code yet to test it within Joplin. Maybe the background will adjust. The background attribute in Mermaid states it is used to calculate color for items that should either be background colored or contrasting to the background.\r\n\r\nIMO someone would have to create a palette themselves that we can then use for dark theme.\r\n\r\nWrt images in flowcharts: I was also looking into this and I can't even make it work in the live editor. So I am not sure how I came up with that problem in the first place. It might have worked with earlier versions of Mermaid, but either way, I haven taken this item off the list."

But that's just me.\r\n\r\nAlso, @sidharthv96, there seem to be a lot of files in the mermaid package. Are you outputting a single minified version of the mermaid package? Or am i just seeing hashes of previous versions in there? There's a runtime performance penalty of Node needing to load many files (I briefly talk about it here: https://jason-williams.co.uk/posts/speeding-up-vscode-extensions-in-2022/)\r\n\r\nSo it looks like the move to 10.0.0 will be blocked for quite a while"

        "body": "**Status**:\n\nFortunately, I can finally work productively again since I got my productive Joplin data back into my Managed NextCloud via JEX import. The fact that there seems to be no longer an ‘exclusive lock’ also helps a lot.\n\nI use my productive Joplin data simultaneously from two Android apps, four Windows apps and two Linux apps. I have been patient and waited until all elements had been downloaded from the NextCloud and decrypted each time a new Joplin app was added. With the Android apps, this took several days each time.\n\nAlthough [all object IDs change with each JEX import](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/2025-02-02-why-do-object-ids-change/43584/3?u=coffee), I now have a manual workaround to avoid this problem. My problem with changing object IDs is that I enter these IDs as ‘External Link’ into other tools such as my calendars and this information is no longer valid after a JEX import because all IDs change. My manual workaround is to copy the corresponding ‘External Link’ information into the content of notes. Thanks to Joplin's wonderful search function, this note can then be found by searching for this ID, even if the current object ID has changed again due to a JEX import. Some of my notes have already had four or more object IDs copied into their content in this way. Now I even write the date as timestamp in the note.\n\n**Assumptions**:\n\nMy Joplin data in the Joplin Cloud had somehow become logically inconsistent. Maybe because I tried to fix conflicts manually, under the mistaken assumption that object IDs never change. But that can't be the only cause of the various problems. I also noticed that the problems often occurred with the notes in a folder whose contents were shared with other Joplin Cloud IDs. I was particularly surprised that I received many messages in connection with Joplin Cloud that I was sometimes unable to decrypt my own notes. Somehow this probably has to do with the presumably very complex key management that has to be carried out by Joplin in connection with the Joplin Cloud and the sharing of folders.\n\nIt could be that many or all logical inconsistencies were removed when the JEX export from the Joplin cloud and the subsequent JEX import into my NextCloud were carried out, precisely because all object IDs change in the process. Since the JEX import into my Next Cloud, I no longer have any such problems and I have not experienced any data loss so far.\n\n**Plan**:\n\nI don't want to touch the data of my various Joplin Cloud IDs again until new versions of the Android app, the Windows app and the Linux app are available that have a chance of working well enough. Then I would proceed as follows:  \na) remove all ‘share folders’ permissions.  \nb) then perform a JEX export of all Joplin Cloud IDs.\n\nAfter that, I see two alternative approaches for how to proceed.\n\nThe reason for this distinction is that unfortunately there is no function to delete all data in the Joplin Cloud in a controlled manner if you, as the owner of the data, want to do so.\n\n**Approach I**: Keep my existing Joplin Cloud IDs  \nc1) then completely delete all notes from all my Joplin Cloud IDs – including from the trash  \nd1) then disable E2EE  \ne1) then wait some time until I can assume that all data in Joplin Cloud has really been deleted  \nf1) refill all Joplin Cloud IDs with the current JEX exports and the new E2EE imports  \ng1) Allow several days for all apps on all of my Joplin Cloud IDs to be fully synchronised and for current changes to be synchronised quickly and accurately between the various apps.  \nh1) After that, share the designated folders with the other IDs again (read only), wait until all the synchronisation processes triggered by this are complete, and then check whether all new changes between the various apps of all Joplin Cloud IDs involved are synchronised quickly and without errors.  \nj1) Only when this state has been properly achieved will I hand the various Joplin Cloud accounts back to my people.\n\nBut maybe that's not a good idea at all. The following approach would probably be more reliable:\n\n**Approach II**: Working with **new** Joplin Cloud IDs and **cancelling the old** IDs:  \nc2) Cancel all my existing (2 Team and 4 Basic) Joplin Cloud accounts.  \nd2) Create 6 new email addresses (redirects) for new Joplin Cloud IDs  \ne2) Create 6 new (2 Team and 4 Basic) Joplin Cloud accounts  \nf2) Fill all new Joplin Cloud accounts with imports of current JEX exports and new E2EE  \ng2) Allow a few days for all apps on all of my Joplin Cloud IDs to fully synchronise and for current changes to be synchronised quickly and accurately between the various apps.  \nh2) Then share the designated folders with the other IDs again (read only), wait until all the synchronisation processes triggered by this are complete, and then check whether all changes between the various apps of all Joplin Cloud IDs involved are synchronised quickly and without errors.  \nj2) Only when this condition has been properly achieved will I hand the various new Joplin Cloud accounts back to my people."

I've been looking for a solution to this, trawling the Forum, GitHub, Google and then came across this old post (as a last resort) but with your amazing 2 blocks of code update and only a few weeks ago! I added these to the latest Joplin Windows release 2.12.18 and can confirm, this seems to be a brilliant solution, despite the very humble \"very rough proof of concept\" comment.\r\n\r\nDespite understanding in isolation the concepts of CSS and some of the syntax, it is not event remotely a strong card so to see this clock of code, despite your comment I thought it was worth a try and I'm sop glad I did - Thank you. \r\n\r\nHopefully, this quick update might encourage other to try and for this to be rolled into a future release, plug-in or similar.

Windows 10, Windows 11).\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNo error should occur on sync.\n\n### Logs\n\n```\r\n03-17T17:48:30: RevisionService: \"maintenance: Done in 32909ms\"\r\n03-17T17:48:29:

        "body": "Thanks for re-creating this. For context, this report is a followup to #5311 which reported two similar issues. One of which was fixed and the issue was closed. \r\n\r\nThis issue however has not been resolved yet.\r\n\r\nI see 3 viable solutions:\r\n1. (Mentioned in #5311) Wait until the application is fully loaded before displaying anything.\r\n  - This is the easiest solution because it only involves moving code around\r\n  - I don't like this solution because it means the user will need to wait potentially a long time without any indication that Joplin is loading\r\n2. Apply a \"splash screen\" during startup\r\n  - It looks like this can be handled pretty simply by having a popup window that [displays a simple html file](https://medium.com/red-buffer/how-to-create-a-splash-screen-for-electron-app-602b4da406d)\r\n  - Would also include the solution from #1\r\n3. (Linked in #5311) Load the settings.json file, extract the theme and apply an appropriate background colour\r\n  - This is probably the simplest fix from the user perspective\r\n  - It involves a kludge (Joplin would be loading settings.json in two different locations)\r\n\r\nPersonally I think 2 is the best solution. It will give Joplin a more polished feel without adding *much* complexity. Of course, the best solution is 1 combined with major updates to make Joplin load faster."

I used appimagetool to repackage the Joplin Appimage (2.14.20) without the library in question and Joplin then successfully finds the system libnotify.so.4, resulting in a notification. Hopefully someone will update the official appimages soon (either drop the lib or replace with an updated one, IMHO better to drop it since (AFAIK) it seems to be needed only by notify-send, which is external to the appimage).\r\nWith notifications working properly in GNOME, one can check out this [GNOME shell extension](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/voluble), which reads out loud the notifications emitted by Joplin."

Whenever I add quotation marks to my search, no results are returned. This includes results that were being displayed before adding the quotation marks.\n\nFor instance, I first searched for `due Friday`, which returned 5 results including instances of \"due Friday\" and \"Friday\". Once I add quotation marks, i.e. `\"due Friday\"`, all the results disappear. Adding the slash, i.e. `/\"due Friday\"`, makes no difference at all."

Each is labelled with \"Level A\", \"Level AA\", or \"Level AAA\". These correspond to different [conformance levels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conf-req1).\n\n## Conformance levels\n\nThere are three different conformance levels[^1]:\n\n- Level A: All Level A success criteria are satisfied.\n    - This is the lowest level of conformance.\n- Level AA: All Level A **and** Level AA success criteria are satisfied.\n- Level AAA: **All** success criteria are satisfied.\n\nAccording to WebAIM.org[^2],\n\n> Most websites should aim for Level AA conformance. Depending on the target users, some Level AAA success criteria such as [Reading Level,](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc3.1.5) [Contrast (Enhanced),](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.4.6) [Target Size](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.5.5), or others may be beneficial to implement. Very few websites can claim full Level AAA conformance—not even webaim.org or the WCAG website itself!\n\nThe WCAG's definition of the different conformance levels[^1] confirms WebAIM's statement that Level AAA is not always achievable:\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> \n> It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content.\n\nBased on the above, for now, this issue targets **Level AA** conformance with the WCAG.\n\n[^1]: https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conf-req1\n[^2]: https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/#current\n\n## This issue: General tasks\n\n- [ ] Find existing accessibility issues & link them to this task.\n- [ ] Go through the [WCAG 2.2 quick reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.2&showtechniques=241%2C243#keyboard-accessible) and evaluate each task. Create issues for failures.\n\n**Notes**: In this issue, different task priorities are marked differently. For example,\n\n- [ ] [❗] This is a task that **must** be completed.\n\t- This should be used mostly for level A tasks.\n- [ ] [🟡] This is a task that *should* be completed.\n\t- This should be used mostly for level AA tasks.\n- [ ] \\[🔷\\] This is a low priority task that *may* be completed.\n- [ ] \\[🔎\\] The priority of this task is unclear and requires additional research.\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> The tasks below are a work-in-progress and **based on** the WCAG 2.2 spec. Completing the tasks below does not guarantee compliance with the spec.\n\n# Quick list of general issues\n\n- **Mobile**:\n\t- [x] Accessibility focus visits nonfunctional \"new note\" and \"new to-do\" buttons.\n\t\t- Fixed for now by changing the component used for the new note menu.\n\t\t- Upstream issue will be fixed by https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper/pull/4498, but it's taking a long time for the pull request to get reviewed.

Meaningful Sequence (Level A)\n\n> When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined. (Level A)\n\n- [x] Joplin currently adjusts focus order by overriding <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>shift</kbd>\\-<kbd>tab</kbd>. See [SC 2.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order).\n- [x] \\[🔎\\] Meaningful sequences can be particularly easy to disrupt using `flex-order` or similar order-changing CSS.

However, it may be difficult to use the desktop app on a phone-sized device in portrait mode. In particular, without moving the sidebars from \"View\" > \"Change application layout\".\n\n- [x] \\[🔎\\] Does this require better by-default support for small screens? If so, a possible solution could be to minimize secondary panels (e.g. by moving them to an overflow tab) when low on space. *(Note: I do not think we need to support this, simply because we are not a website but an app designed for a specific platform. The desktop app is for relatively wide screens, and for smaller screens we have the mobile app)*\n    - [x] This might be part of [§1.4.10](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html).\n\n## 1.3.5.

It still can be customised using chrome.css though.\n\n### 1.4.13: [Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#content-on-hover-or-focus) (AA)\n\nWhen content (e.g. tooltips) can be shown by hovering with the mouse pointer, it should also be possible to show them with a keyboard.\n\nAt present, this isn't possible with most `title=` tooltips (at least on Linux). However, the WCAG includes an exception that might be relevant here:\n\n> **Exception**: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.\n\nAs an Electron app, however, Joplin **is** the user agent, and so this might not apply.\n\n- [x] [🟡] Currently, most tooltips can only be shown by hovering with a mouse (see [this Chromium bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40570289)).

[Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#accessible-authentication-enhanced) (Level AAA)\n\nThe WCAG states:\n\n> This criterion is the same as [Accessible Authentication (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum) but without the exceptions for objects and user-provided content.\n\nJoplin should allow pasting passwords from password managers or other applications when signing in to sync targets that authenticate through the app. Sync targets that authenticate through a web browser (e.g. Joplin Cloud) should also allow using the user's password manager.\n\n## §4 - Robust\n\n> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.\n\n### 4.1.2. [Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#name-role-value) (Level A)\n\n> For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.\n>\n> *Note 1*: This success criterion is primarily for Web authors who develop or script their own user interface components. For example, standard HTML controls already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.\n\nAt present, most ARIA-related tasks are listed under SC 1.3.1. In addition to those, issues include:\n\n- [x] [❗] Correctly convey the structure of the font picker control in settings -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11763\n- [x] [❗] Correctly convey the structure of the note list (e.g. with semantic HTML or `role=`).\n    - Partial: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/10940\n- [x] [❗] Correctly convey the structure of the notebook and tag list (use [the treeview pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/)).\n    - https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11196\n- [x] [❗] Correctly convey the structure of Goto Anything search results.\n    - Related: [WAI ARIA Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/)\n    - https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/10816\n- [x] [❗] Correctly convey the structure of the settings sidebar.\n    - https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/10812 adds additional `aria` information (e.g. `aria-controls`).\n- [x] [❗]  Note and Markdown toolbars -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/10819\n- [x] [❗]  Date/time picker for to-dos -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11725\n\n## 4.1.3. [Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#status-messages) (Level AA)\n> In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.\n\nSeveral status messages need appropriate accessibility information to be exposed:\n- [x] [🟡] #11741 -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11776\n    - Currently, it's **very** confusing when the note list disappears (with no announcement).\n    - One possible solution [is to add a new status indicator](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/compare/dev...personalizedrefrigerator:pr/desktop/accessibility/announce-visiblepanes-changes). However, with the current status indicator logic, this adds a new focusable item to the end of the document. \n- [x] [🟡] #11742\n- [ ] [🟡] Announce changes made by the \"toggle editor layout\" command — hiding the note viewer when not focused currently isn't announced.\n- [ ] [🟡] Sync status message.\n\t- Marking the sync status region with `role=status` could be distracting when navigating with a screen reader. Implement https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/8611 first.\n\t- Using `role=log` is one possible alternative.\n- [x] [🟡] Searching: Announce changes to results -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11634\n- [ ] [🟡] Error messages in settings.\n- [x] [🟡]  Importing/exporting modal.\n- [ ] [🟡]  Top-of-screen error banner (for sync & decryption errors).\n- [ ] [🟡] Changes to the Markdown editor from the toolbar -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11441\n- [x] [🟡] Moving panels in the \"change application layout\" dialog.\n    - When it's easier to move the keyboard focus to the \"move\" buttons (and the buttons are labelled, see https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11718), this issue will be more noticeable. \n- [ ] [🟡] [🔎] Rich Text Editor -- when selection moves to a code block. (To check: Is this a status update issue or a missing label issue?)\n    -  In the Rich Text Editor, when the selection moves to a code block, the Orca screen reader reads nothing (despite Orca reading the code block when it is **not** selected, but on the same line as the cursor). Instead, nothing is read (not even a \"selection updated\" notification)."

According [to `w3.org`](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/#using-the-title-attribute),\r\n> The title attribute can also be used to identify form controls. This approach is generally less reliable and not recommended because some screen readers and assistive technologies do not interpret the title attribute as a replacement for the label element, possibly because the title attribute is often used to provide non-essential information.\r\n\r\nBased on this, `aria-label` is being added in some cases where a button/link has no text content, even if it already has a `title`.\r\n\r\n**Related links**:\r\n- [Advisory technique: Describing a link's purpose with aria-label](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/aria/ARIA8.html)\r\n- [How different screen readers interpret link + title and link + aria-label](https://www.deque.com/blog/text-links-practices-screen-readers/)\r\n\r\n\r\n> If I knew what the mobile apps and desktop apps were made in, I could better advise but this is a great start!\r\n\r\nThe desktop app is built with Electron and React.

For example, Joplin uses FontAwesome `<i>` webfont icons. For this type of icon, [ARIA 24](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/aria/ARIA24.html) recommends:\r\n> Some low vision users need user stylesheets, scripts, or extensions to override the fonts on a page to perceive text content. However, they need to be able to perceive icon fonts that are meaningful, such as a star signifying a favorite, or an email icon in a link.\r\n>\r\n> The key is for the author to semantically markup icon fonts with role=\"img\". Then the user's font replacement selector can hook into that semantic and exclude role=\"img\". This results in those icon fonts being shown.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to webfont+`role=img` could be to use SVG icons (e.g. with [FontAwesome SVG](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/dig-deeper/webfont-vs-svg)). However, this would likely require significant code changes."

SVG icons are much better in this aspect, but as you've said, implementing them would require a major rewrite of the code 🙁."

        "body": "\n> [🔎] How can we make it easy for users to add alternative text to videos and audio elements?\n\n**[Suggest close]** When attaching a video, it puts the filename as the title, eg `[myvideo.mp4](:/5ca9d953c01643d6a503b473c1e92a2d)`. Then in the renderer this is used for the link `title` attribute and for the content: `<a href=\"...\" title=\"myvideo.mp4\">myvideo.mp4</a>`. Isn't it sufficient? Beyond this, I believe it is not the app responsability to make the user content accessible - they have the option to give detailed description in the title or not, but we can't control that, so I don't think there is more to do? Or maybe putting the text in the `alt` attribute too?\n\n> [🔎] Does Joplin use ::before or ::after to include non-decorative content (see F87)?\n\nWe use `::before` to render the checkboxes in the RTE checkbox lists. I suspect it would be difficult to improve this.\n\n> [🔎] Does Joplin use structural markup to achieve a visual-only effect? (F43 and related).\n\n**[Suggest close]** Very hard to say but generally we use semantic markup so I would think there are not many such instances. The link provides example of using `blockquote` for indentation or `h4` to make something bold and we generally don't do this. I think it's safe to tick that item off now.\n\n> [🔎] Meaningful sequences can be particularly easy to disrupt using flex-order or similar order-changing CSS. Are we using flex-order anywhere? See F1.\n\n**[Suggest close]** Same comment as above - as the HTML is relatively clean I suspect we don't have too many strange out of order sequences. We don't use `flex-order` as far as I can see.\n\n> [🔎] Does this include RTL support? (Related issue).\n\n**[Suggest close]** We do not officially support RTL for now. If certain things work it's great but I know there are still issues and fixing this would be a project of its own.\n\n> (Different task) Check the documentation website.\n\n**[Suggest close]** I've searched for basic colours in the documentation - green, blue, etc. and didn't find any instructions based on colours. Only possible exception is [here](https://joplinapp.org/help/api/tutorials/cm6_plugin/#style-the-active-line) where it says \"The active line should now have a light-yellow background\". But I'm not sure how that could be improved. Possibly also out of scope for this project (which is about accessibility for the end user rather than for developers).\n\n> [🔎] Does this require better by-default support for small screens? If so, a possible solution could be to minimize secondary panels (e.g. by moving them to an overflow tab) when low on space.\n\n**[Suggest close]** I'd think this is out of scope for the desktop app because we provide the mobile app for smaller devices\n\n> [🔎] Check color contrast between neighboring content.\n\n> [🔎] Check user interface components (non-text) in the desktop app for contrast in the default theme.\n\n> Add a high-contrast theme for the markdown editor?\n\nI think these three items are similar? Basically about having sufficient contrasts between adjacent elements.\n\nI couldn't actually find a tool to check this. The [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) is to compare foreground and background colour, which is not the same as comparing, for example, the colour the selected notebook background against the whole sidebar background colour. We need something to test adjacent colours it seems.\n\nWe have a visible focus indicator in any case which would be part of the Sufficient Techniques: \"G195: Using an author-supplied, visible focus indicator\"\n\n> 1.4.12: Text spacing: [🔎] How can this be done with Joplin (if at all)? Is Joplin still usable in this case?\n\nI think that's for web pages where user can provide a user CSS stylesheet? \n\nAs a test I think we should try to set a custom stylesheet for the Markdown editor, RTE and viewer with the mentioned properties and see if it still works. If it doesn't we should evaluate if there are simple fixes we can implement - if it's too complex we should drop it.\n\nAnd we shouldn't support this for the rest of the interface. The guideline mentions \"content\" which I think is understood to be articles, etc., not user interface elements.\n\n> [🔎] Currently, it's difficult to move the keyboard focus to the \"new note\"/\"new to-do\"/\"sync\" buttons\n\n**[Suggest close]** Not sure if something has changed but I was able to move the focus to all these buttons with both TAB and Shift+TAB\n\n> [🔎] Is it possible to cause the UI to flash more than three times? (Check cases involving dark mode transitioning to light mode and switching notes with resources that need to load).\n\n**[Suggest close]** I tried and couldn't get anything to flash three times. Including loading HTML notes. So I'd say we can skip this one.\n\n> [🔷] [🔎] Check for other cases where the focus can be hidden by another item. (Trash notification?)\n\n**[Suggest close]** I'm not sure I understand this guideline. But using the keyboard I could give focus to the notification \"Cancel\" button as would be expected. That notification also doesn't hide enough of the content or for long enough to be a problem.\n\n> 2.4.13. Focus Appearance (Level AAA)\n>\n> 2.5.5. Target Size (Enhanced) (Level AAA)\n>\n> 2.5.6. Concurrent Input Mechanisms (Level AAA)\n\nShould we skip the AAA items?\n\n> [🔎] Check for focus causing changes in context.\n\n**[Suggest close]** Even without accessibility in mind that would be bad design probably, and I can't think of any such instance.\n\n> [🔎] The keyboard shortcuts screen shows an error message only when the user hovers over or clicks on the \"warning\" icon. Is this sufficient?\n\nI'm not sure why it was done this way, and I don't feel it's very good. We should change it to display the message below the keyboard shortcut, unless there's a good reason for the current UI."

There is one question I have that I might just be misunderstanding.\nThe list of notebooks is a treeview, in that your notebooks can contain notebooks. I'm coming from CherryTree, where the notes within the notebooks also show up as treeview items within the given notebook, so a right arrow drills down into the list of notes for the given notebook.\nIn Joplin, I'm noticing that you're meant to rpess Enter on a notebook, t which point you get routed to the list of notes for that notebook. This works well, but I didn't immediately see how you're meant to quickly get back to the list of notebooks from there, this takes several shift+tabs or tabs.\nIDEA: make right arrow on a notebook that has no sub-notebooks move to the note list, and left arrow in the note list move back to the notebook list, given those keys don't currently do anything in those views anyway.

Joplin opens and works as normal.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Issues without reproduction steps are likely to stall.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Describe what you expected to happen\r\n\r\nI expected Joplin to open without the intervening solid gray screen, or at least such that doesn't last as long as a minute.\r\n\r\nNote that when I first started experiencing this (when 2.10.x was in beta), I thought it could be related to synchronization. But today, I tried setting the synchronization target from my usual 'OneDrive' to 'None', unloading the app, and relaunching it - and I still see the minute-long solid gray screen.\r\n\r\n## Logfile\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please attach a debug log. Issues without a debug log are likely to stall.\r\n  For information on how to collect a log file: https://joplinapp.org/debugging/\r\n-->\r\nI reviewed the log from the Android app and there are no errors/warnings presented from my testing of this issue today, whether synchronization was on or off."

I asked gemni AI getting the answer below:\r\nThe error you're seeing in Joplin on Windows 11, which includes the code snippet:\r\n\r\nCSS\r\n\r\nNote viewer body { overflow: hidden; }\r\n#joplin-container-content {\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    overflow-y: auto;\r\n    padding-left: 10px;\r\n    padding-right: 10px;\r\n}\r\nis not actually an error message in the traditional sense. It's the CSS code that Joplin uses to style the note viewer. This code is being displayed directly in your notes, which is the problem.\r\n\r\nHere's a breakdown of why this happens and how to fix it:\r\n\r\nReason:\r\n\r\nThis issue usually arises due to a conflict or bug related to how Joplin renders or parses certain Markdown content, particularly when it involves HTML or CSS. It's been reported in the Joplin community before (as seen in the search results). The core issue is that this styling code, intended for the note viewer itself, is somehow being injected into the note content as plain text.\r\n\r\nSolutions:\r\n\r\nUpdate Joplin: The most straightforward solution is to ensure you're running the latest version of Joplin. Bugs are often fixed in newer releases. Check for updates within the Joplin application or download the latest version from the official Joplin website.\r\n\r\nCheck for Conflicting Plugins or Custom CSS: If you're using any Joplin plugins or have applied custom CSS through userchrome.css or userstyle.css, these could be interfering with the rendering process. Try temporarily disabling plugins or removing custom CSS to see if the issue resolves. If it does, re-enable them one by one to identify the culprit.\r\n\r\nInspect the Note Content: Carefully examine the Markdown content of the affected notes. Look for any unusual HTML tags, inline styles, or CSS code blocks that might be causing the problem. Sometimes, even seemingly innocuous HTML can trigger rendering issues. If you find any, try removing or correcting them.\r\n\r\nRecreate the Note (if possible): If the issue is isolated to a few notes, try copying the content of the affected notes and creating new notes with that content. This can sometimes resolve underlying formatting issues.\r\n\r\nUser CSS workarounds (Advanced): If the problem persists and you're comfortable with CSS, you can try adding some CSS to your userstyle.css to hide the unwanted code. However, this is more of a workaround than a true fix. You could try something like this:\r\n\r\nCSS\r\n\r\ndiv.codeblock { /* Or a more specific selector if needed */\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\nThis would hide any <div> elements with the class \"codeblock.\" You'll need to inspect the HTML source of the rendered note (using your browser's developer tools if needed) to find the appropriate CSS selector to target the unwanted code.\r\n\r\nImportant Note: The issue you're encountering is likely a bug or a rendering quirk within Joplin. The provided solutions are aimed at mitigating the problem. If the issue persists after trying these steps, it's recommended to report the bug on the Joplin GitHub repository or the Joplin forum, providing as much detail as possible (including the Joplin version, operating system, and steps to reproduce the issue). This will help the Joplin developers to identify and fix the root cause."

Specifically, when I type a sentence and then switch to another note, after returning to the original note, the last few words I typed are missing. For example, I typed the following sentence:\n\n\"英文问题，会唔会问完hobby，优缺点之外，继续问多条额外\"\n\nAfter switching to another note and coming back, I only see（The part with strikethrough is what's missing.）:\n\n\"英文问题，会唔会问完hobby，优缺点之外，继续~~问多条额外~~\"\n\nThis issue has been happening repeatedly. I’m unsure if it’s related to note syncing or any other factors. Has anyone else faced this issue? Any suggestions on how to fix it?\n\nThank you!\n\n================================================\n\nI do switch to another note quickly after making edits, usually within 1-5 seconds. Even if I wait 5 seconds before switching, note content still gets lost.\n\nI'm using Windows 10 LTSC 2019.\n\nMy Joplin is not using any sync service; all my data is stored locally on my computer.\n\n================================================\n\nI use the Sogou Pinyin input method to enter a piece of text without adding punctuation at the end. Regardless of whether it is full-width or half-width punctuation or numbers, switching to another note and switching back will cause the previously entered content to disappear.\n\n我用搜狗拼音输入法，输入完一段文字，没在后面加标点符号，不论是全角还是半角标点，或者数字，切换到其他笔记再切换回来，刚才输入的内容就会消失\n\n1.Sogou Pinyin Input Method: Chinese + Full-width Punctuation. No problem.\n\n搜狗拼音输入法：中文+全角标点。没问题\n\ntext:中文后面跟着全角标点句号。\n\n2.Sogou Pinyin Input Method: Chinese + Half-width Punctuation. No problem.\n\n搜狗拼音输入法：中文+半角标点。没问题\n\ntext:中文后面跟着半角标点句号.\n\n3.Sogou Pinyin Input Method: Chinese + Numbers. No problem.\n\n搜狗拼音输入法：中文+数字。没问题\n\ntext:中文后面跟着数字2\n\n4.Windows EN-US Input Method: Entering English, No problem.\n\nwindows的EN-US输入法：输入英文，没问题。\n\ntext:english mode\n\n5.Sogou Pinyin Input Method: English, entered in Sogou Pinyin's English mode. No problem.\n\n搜狗拼音输入法：英文，以搜狗拼音的英文模式输入。没问题\n\ntext:sougou pinyin\n\n6.Sogou Pinyin Input Method: Chinese. Switching to another note and switching back will cause the text to disappear.（The part with strikethrough is what's missing.）\n\n搜狗拼音输入法：中文。切换到其他笔记再切换回来，文字会消失\n\ntext:搜狗拼音打中文后面~~不加标点符号和数字~~\n\n7.Sogou Pinyin Input Method: English, entered in Sogou Pinyin's Chinese mode by pressing Enter or Shift. Switching to another note and switching back will cause the text to disappear.（The part with strikethrough is what's missing.）\n\n搜狗拼音输入法：英文，以搜狗拼音的中文模式输入，按enter或者shift输入英文。切换到其他笔记再切换回来，文字会消失。\n\ntext:~~hello~~\n\n \n\nSo, it is an incompatibility issue between Joplin and the Sogou Pinyin input method that causes text loss when switching notes. So far, I have only found this issue in Joplin; other software like Word, Evernote, and Notepad.exe does not have this problem.\n\n所以，是joplin不兼容搜狗拼音输入法导致切换笔记导致文字消失的问题。目前我只发现joplin有这样的问题，其他软件word，Evernote，notepad.exe等等都没有这样的问题。\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nfix the bug\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_"

As mentioned I think you should try using the latest official version of Sogou Pinyin and see if that helps. I'm not sure how / where you obtained the modified build, but maybe you could find an updated version of it if upgrading resolves the issue."

That was with Dropbox, so we should test with it. Make many changes to notebooks - change title, move them in other notebooks, etc. And see if we can replicate a conflict.\n\nMore information:\n\n> I had a notebook for the company I work for, let's say \"Company\".\n> I decided to nest it under a new notebook called \"Work\", therefore I right-clicked on it and create a new notebook called \"Work\". However now it was \"Work\" inside \"Company\", so I dragged \"Work\" out and then dragged \"Company\" into it.\n\nRef: https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/renamed-the-notes-notebook-to-something-else-and-upon-synchronising-i-lost-everything/44086?u=laurent"

This is actually my first time reporting an issue, so please forgive me if I'm not posting this in the right place.\n\nI’d like to explain what happened:\n\nAt the organization I work with, we wanted to share notes among team members, and we found that Joplin paired with Joplin Server was the perfect solution. We've been using it for about a week now, and everything was going very well.\n\nHowever, today I decided to rearrange the folder structure. After finishing the reorganization, I was surprised to find that several folders had disappeared completely. I couldn't find them anywhere.\n\nThankfully, those folders only contained experimental notes I was preparing as a concept for the team. But this experience was quite scary — what if it had happened to more important data?\n\nWhile checking the logs, I found the following entries, which seem to indicate a delete action during sync:\n```\n2025-05-10 14:02:49: DeleteAction: sync: handleConflictAction: non-note conflict: folder title: \"Self-Host\",titles: [\"MailDEV\"]; Item IDs: [\"2cee83a7264a402499d5caa1327bde70\"]\n2025-05-10 14:02:49: DeleteAction: sync: handleConflictAction: non-note conflict: folder title: \"Self-Host\",titles: [\"MailDEV\"],folder title: \"WireGuard\",folder title: \"WGDashboard\",titles: [\"WGDashboard Docker Explanation\",\"Note: WGDashboard\",\"README.md\"]; Item IDs: [\"838f07b665194baa957dfec5fbb71043\",\"f3d76cd902d94657b9735157b73b87a3\",\"ab6c8aedc6e143948180923df9dbd75a\"]\n2025-05-10 14:02:49: DeleteAction: sync: handleConflictAction: non-note conflict: folder title: \"Self-Host\",titles: [\"MailDEV\"],folder title: \"WireGuard\",folder title: \"WGDashboard\",titles: [\"WGDashboard Docker Explanation\",\"Note: WGDashboard\",\"README.md\"]; Item IDs: [\"6da8e2d421d241d1b52d030018ebfd3a\"]\n2025-05-10 14:02:49: DeleteAction: sync: handleConflictAction: non-note conflict: folder title: \"Self-Host\",titles: [\"MailDEV\"],folder title: \"WireGuard\",folder title: \"WGDashboard\",titles: [\"WGDashboard Docker Explanation\",\"Note: WGDashboard\",\"README.md\"],folder title: \"Netbird\",titles: [\"Note: Netbird\",\"README.md\"]; Item IDs: [\"88514c77f5c5420985e36a98e40f39c5\",\"a29bc25e38d147b29f89b9ec4961d9c3\"]\n2025-05-10 14:02:49: DeleteAction: sync: handleConflictAction: non-note conflict: folder title: \"Self-Host\",titles: [\"MailDEV\"],folder title: \"WireGuard\",folder title: \"WGDashboard\",titles: [\"WGDashboard Docker Explanation\",\"Note: WGDashboard\",\"README.md\"],folder title: \"Netbird\",titles: [\"Note: Netbird\",\"README.md\"]; Item IDs: [\"8f9b809d94994763a73aebfeb47c11e3\"]\n2025-05-10 14:02:49: DeleteAction: sync: handleConflictAction: non-note conflict: folder title: \"Self-Host\",titles: [\"MailDEV\"],folder title: \"WireGuard\",folder title: \"WGDashboard\",titles: [\"WGDashboard Docker Explanation\",\"Note: WGDashboard\",\"README.md\"],folder title: \"Netbird\",titles: [\"Note: Netbird\",\"README.md\"]; Item IDs: [\"e5827724d2224e5281cc47c781915947\"]\n2025-05-10 14:02:49: DeleteAction: sync: handleConflictAction: non-note conflict: folder title: \"Self-Host\",titles: [\"MailDEV\"],folder title: \"WireGuard\",folder title: \"WGDashboard\",titles: [\"WGDashboard Docker Explanation\",\"Note: WGDashboard\",\"README.md\"],folder title: \"Netbird\",titles: [\"Note: Netbird\",\"README.md\"]; Item IDs: [\"0318f73794ae4b0ba817d6372c9362ee\"]\n```\nFor context: I'm not using Dropbox — this is all happening with Joplin Server.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* What could have triggered this deletion?\n* Is there a way to avoid this kind of issue in the future?\n* Should I avoid rearranging folders while sync is running?\n\nThanks again for your efforts, and apologies for the long message!"

        "body": "@balnaimi I suspect the issue in this thread is the same as https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/12089 which someone else who is a Joplin server user has raised.\n\nIt's helpful to see that the activity in the logs for both issues appears to be the same.\n\nI can't say the cause of these issues, however one thing I do know from running my own tests with syncing in Joplin is that if the server object which defines the notebook for a collection of notes is deleted, all the notes within that notebook can disappear from the Joplin UI despite the objects still existing on the server. So I suspect this is what has happened, as the logs all say 'non-note conflict' rather than note deletions. If you were not using Joplin server / cloud you could identify the relevant objects from the recycle bin on the server and restore them, and then create a new profile and re-sync with the sync target, which should allow the notes to be restored. But unfortunately with Joplin server / cloud there is no recycle bin and you can't manipulate the server objects directly.\n\nUnfortunately I can't advise on how you could avoid this happening in future, but I can advise that until this bug has been fixed, in future you might want to make a full jex export before attempting any rename or re-organisation of notebooks, so you don't lose anything important if it happens again. If you're just moving notes between notebooks but without changing notebook names or structure, then I think you'll be alright.\n\nI do have some questions though:\n1. Is the notebook which disappeared one which was being shared?\n2. If so, is it possible that any of the other users who the notebook was shared with renamed or restructured the folder at the same time that you did?\n3. Has the notebook in question disappeared for other users which it is shared with?"

That is rather than doing lots of different moves in and out of nesting before triggering the sync. And also make sure everything is fully synced before attempting restructures."

Because to reach this scenario, somehow the remote item was deleted without the user deleting the notebook locally, so most likely the matching local item exists and is marked as synced on every client. While the user wouldn't see any difference (the conflict would appear in the logs though), it would probably block any further updates to that object on the server without any prompt or warning to the user.\n\nSo I think you have to do something to break the cycle: either delete the local item or mark it back as unsynced so that it will be recreated on the next trigger of the sync (the latter being my suggestion - clear sync_time rather than update updated_time)"

        "body": "I have done some investigation and found that the first time the evernote imported note is opened, the onFieldChange handler (NoteEditor.tsx) is triggered with a change to the 'body' field. I compared the contents of the note in the sqlite db before and after opening the imported note for the first time, and I found that while the text contents look the same, the binary representation of the note contents have different values:\n\nbefore:\n2d2d2d74747474742d2d2d0a2d2d2d74\n747474742d2d2d0d3132333132333a0d\n312e746573740d322e722e702e\n\nafter:\n2d2d2d74747474742d2d2d0a2d2d2d74\n747474742d2d2d0a3132333132333a0a\n312e746573740a322e722e702e\n\nThe differences are instances of 0d (carriage return) are replaced with 0a (line feed) hex values after opening.\nSo the problem is that when you open an imported note for the first time, if it contains carriage returns they are immediately replaced with line feeds, which then triggers a save.\n\nUPDATE: If others have not been able to reproduce it with the provided jex file, it may be an OS specific issue, or possibly even Windows 10 specific.\n\nAlso I only can reproduce the issue if the markdown editor is enabled before switching to the note for the first time. If I have the rich text editor enabled the first time, the updated time remains as it should be. If I then enable the markdown editor, if I switch to another note and then switch back to the note, the updated time gets updated. So it's possibly an upstream CodeMirror issue."

So it's likely something that would happen if you edit the same note on different operating systems."

        "body": "### Operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Joplin version\n\n3.3.1\n\n### Desktop version info\n\nJoplin 3.3.1 (prod, linux)\n\nID do cliente: <>\nVersão Sync: 3\nVersão do Perfil: 47\nKeychain Suportada: Não\n\nRevisão: da59aef\n\nBackup: 1.4.2\nFreehand Drawing: 2.15.0\nMarkdown Table: Sortable: 1.2.2\nMenu items, Shortcuts, Toolbar icons: 1.1.0\nNote Tabs: 1.4.0\nQuick Links: 1.3.2\nRich Markdown: 0.15.1\nVictor: 1.0.3\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nThere is a weird and inconsistent behavior of intendation. It started to behave differently since version <3.1.x\n...\n\n**How to reproduce:**\nCase 1: Expected behaviour\n- Go to the end of \"Dora\" and type Enter three times: 1. Creates new checkpoint, 2. Intends one two the right, 3. Removes the checkpoint. This is the expected behaviour I know from < 3.1.x Joplin.\n\nCase 2: Unexpected behaviour\n- Now go to the end of \"Ant\" and type Enter two times: 1. Adds new checklist item, 2. Here it is confusing: Instead of removing the list item, it creates a new blank line and shifts the new checklist item from step 1 one line downwards. Only if you press a third time enter, then it removes the list item, but then it has already created two empty lines.\n\nFirst I was wondering if it has something to do with the intendation. But it happens also with \"Heading 2\". Case 1 applies for \"Fargo\", \"Good\" or \"Hola\"... so where the button enter works as expected. But case 2 happens with \"Ant\" or \"Hola\" or even \"Charlie\"... so always when its the first item in the list.\n\nUse this as an example (do not use code formatting, when testing it in joplin)\n```\n# Checklist\n- [ ] Ant\n- [ ] Bear\n\t- [ ] Charlie\n\t- [ ] Dora\n\n# Checklist 2\n- [ ] Earn\n- [ ] Fargo\n- [ ] Good\n- [ ] Hola\n```\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n\nThis behaviour affect ordered, unordered and checklist items.\n\nHaving different behaviours is really confusing. It disturbs the workflow imho. Sometimes I want to split a list and by one empty line. When I start doing it with the first list item I always have to clean up the left over list item, which looks then like this:\n```\n- [ ] Earn\n\n- [ ] \n- [ ] Fargo\n- [ ] Good\n- [ ] Hola\n```\n\nExpected behaviour would be: \n1. Press enter until intended completely left\n2. Another enter removes the list item (like ordered, unordered or checklist item)\n3. Another enter just adds blank lines.\n\nSo case 1 and 3 are expected, case 2 not.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_"

        "body": "This issue may be a duplicate of #11382. \r\n\r\n#11382 seems to be caused by an issue with how Joplin saves the Rich Text Editor's content as Markdown. In particular,  bulleted list items that contain a single user-resized image are saved incorrectly. When the Rich Text Editor loads from the saved Markdown, sub-list items immediately after the image are interpreted as HTML (and not as Markdown). Also see [this comment](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/11382#issuecomment-2549477669).\r\n\r\nNote that list items after the first might still be list items (and perhaps interpreted as code?) in some cases. For example, starting with the following Markdown,\r\n```markdown\r\n- <img src=\":/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\" width=\"1024\"></img>\r\n    - Sub-list item 1\r\n\r\n    - Sub-list item 2\r\n```\r\nWhen resaved by the Rich Text Editor, the Markdown might lose the closing `</img>` tag and become this:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- <img src=\":/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef\" width=\"1024\">\r\n    - Sub-list item 1\r\n\r\n    - Sub-list item 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, when loaded by the Rich Text Editor, \"- Sub-list item 1\" is interpreted as HTML. \"- Sub-list item 2\" is separated from item 1 by a blank line, so is still interpreted as Markdown:\r\n![sub-list item just after an image has a dash for a bullet point and different indentation from the second list item](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b237dc5-89eb-4238-bb40-abf81add2091)\r\n"

Launch joplin-desktop\r\n2. Summon an external editor for note A\r\n3. add one line and save in the editor, and quit the editor.\r\n4. Summon an external editor for note A again.\r\n5. delete the line added in the previous session, save, and quit the editor.\r\n6. Summon an external editor for note B\r\n7. add one line and save in the editor, and quit the editor.\r\n8. repeat 6 and 7 one more time in vain.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nJoplin should watch the file carefully every note the user summoned an external editor for. --not just the first one.\r\n(I guess `Event: unlink` should not show up in the log, it's interesting that the change in the first note's corresponding file doesn't produce `Event: unlink`)\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n```\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js:29895 Download the React DevTools for a better development experience: https://reactjs.org/link/react-devtoolsYou might need to use a local HTTP server (instead of file://): https://reactjs.org/link/react-devtools-faq\r\nmain-html.js:65 Environment: prod\r\nmain-html.js:87 appId: net.cozic.joplin-desktop\r\nmain-html.js:89 appType: desktop\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/@joplin/utils/dist/Logger.js:259 19:46:02: App: Profile directory: /home/dewr/.config/joplin-desktop\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/@joplin/utils/dist/Logger.js:259 19:46:02: App: Root profile directory: /home/dewr/.config/joplin-desktop\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/@joplin/utils/dist/Logger.js:259 19:46:02: Database was open successfully\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/@joplin/utils/dist/Logger.js:259 19:46:02: Checking for database schema update...\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/@joplin/utils/dist/Logger.js:259 19:46:02: Current database version Object\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/@joplin/utils/dist/Logger.js:259 19:46:02: Upgrading database from version 47\r\n/tmp/.mount_JoplineTyvJW/resources/app.asar/node_modules/@joplin/utils/dist/Logger.js:259 19:46:02: New version: 47.

In which situation it would be desirable to rather \"delete\" then \"cut\" ? Why `Shift+Insert` and `Ctrl+Insert` is working then ?\n\n> you can assign the keyboard shortcuts of cut/paste to Shift+Del and Shift+Insert in the settings\n\nThank you, I tried that, but it's not working:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8adf131f-1a49-490b-b523-42f972d94e50)\n\nHowever if it worked I assume that `Ctrl+X` and `Ctrl+V` would stop working, right ? That wouldn't be great either.\n\nMy suggestion is \n- either hardcode `Shift+Del` to \"cut\" command (unless manually assigned by user to different command) which would be consistent with `Shift+Insert`/`Ctrl+Insert` currently hardcoded to \"paste\"/\"copy\" command \n- or allow multiple keyboard shortcuts to single command (more flexible but overkill IMO).\n\n\n"

A webdav server has no concept of whether an item is synced, only the client does. So requiring human intevention in this scenario would mean that every time a genuine deletion is made by a user on one client, all other clients would require human intervention to determine whether the local deletion should occur when the client is synced. This would not be very practical from a usability perspective.\n\nIf the note count is completely different on your Android compared to your Linux device when they are both synced up to date, then that is a completely different issue."

This is generally the compromise of restoring any kind of backup though.\n\nNormally, the data on the server should not be changed outside of the Joplin client, because it is the source of truth for all clients and messing something up can then mess up all of your clients."

However, after syncing, the search result doesn't return new notes.\r\n\r\nIn my setup, I have 2 clients: my Joplin Desktop syncs to WebDAV and a CLI client syncs to the same WebDAV.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Start API server on CLI client: `joplin --profile /joplin/profile server start` \r\n- On Joplin Desktop app, create a new note (e.g., \"Foobar\") in notebook \"Welcome!\"\r\n- Sync from Joplin Desktop app to WebDAV\r\n- Calling API from CLI should not return this \"Foobar\" note yet (use note ID from the desktop client)\r\n```\r\n01:52:28: Request: GET /notes/87f0ba5654be445fb6f17ca10f412b04?token=<>\r\n01:52:28: Error: Not Found\r\n```\r\n- Call sync on CLI client: `joplin --profile /joplin/profile sync`\r\n- Call API from CLI returns \"GET /notes/87f0ba5654be445fb6f17ca10f412b04\" OK. Thus, the note data is there after syncing. The log below also shows `87f0ba5654be445fb6f17ca10f412b04` was fetched.\r\n- Call API for search for query `notebook:\"Welcome!\"` doesn't return the note. It returns other notes in the same notebook\r\n```\r\n01:54:19: Request: GET /search?query=notebook%3A%22Welcome%21%22&fields=created_time%2Ctitle%2Cparent_id%2Cuser_updated_time%2Cid&page=1&token=<>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, the search result is stale for some reason. The note data is already there after sync but the search result doesn't reflect the data. Perhaps, the SQLite full-text search needs update to reflect the new data. Is there a command to force SQLite to update?\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nAfter sync, the search result should show the new notes to reflect the data Joplin has.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:14: Synchronizer: Sync: starting: Starting synchronisation to target 6... supportsAccurateTimestamp = false; supportsMultiPut = false} [1736761994055]\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:14: Synchronizer: Indexing resources...\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:14: ResourceService::indexNoteResources: Start\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:14: ResourceService::indexNoteResources: Completed\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:14: Synchronizer: Sync target remote info: {\"version\":3,\"e2ee\":{\"value\":false,\"updatedTime\":0},\"activeMasterKeyId\":{\"value\":\"\",\"updatedTime\":0},\"masterKeys\":[],\"ppk\":{\"value\":null,\"updatedTime\":0},\"appMinVersion\":\"3.0.0\"}\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:14: Synchronizer: Sync target is already setup - checking it...\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:14: Synchronizer: Sync target local info: {\"version\":3,\"e2ee\":{\"value\":false,\"updatedTime\":0},\"activeMasterKeyId\":{\"value\":\"\",\"updatedTime\":0},\"masterKeys\":[],\"ppk\":{\"value\":null,\"updatedTime\":0},\"appMinVersion\":\"3.0.0\"}\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: BasicDelta: Report: {\"timestamp\":1736760874000,\"older\":68598,\"newer\":3,\"equal\":1}\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: supportsDeltaWithItems =  <false>\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: fetchingTotal: Fetching delta items from sync target\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: fetchingProcessed: Processing fetched item\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: createLocal: remote exists but local does not: (Remote 573cb160e8ae464f8e0959e622b57e1b.md)\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: fetchingProcessed: Processing fetched item\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: createLocal: remote exists but local does not: (Remote 87f0ba5654be445fb6f17ca10f412b04.md)\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: fetchingProcessed: Processing fetched item\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: createLocal: remote exists but local does not: (Remote 19a952e3e5094df381285960a3109086.md)\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Sync: finished: Synchronisation finished [1736761994055]\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Operations completed: \r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: fetchingTotal: 3\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: fetchingProcessed: 3\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: createLocal: 3\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Total folders: 72\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Total notes: 20928\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: Synchronizer: Total resources: 19024\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: checkDisabledSyncItemsNotification: No errors: Hiding notification\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: ResourceFetcher: Auto-add resources: Mode: always\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: ResourceFetcher: Auto-added resources: 0\r\n2025-01-13 01:53:18: checkDisabledSyncItemsNotification: No errors: Hiding notification\r\n```"

        "body": "`joplin search --index` command would be very useful. \r\n\r\nIn addition, should sync and API calls trigger indexing automatically? For example, API calls that update data (e.g., POST, PUT) should trigger indexing so that the next API call to `/search` API will reflect the new data instead of waiting for indexing by a separate `joplin search --index` or TUI. Similarly, after a `joplin sync`, Joplin should know any note has changed by the sync and can add indexing at the end? \r\n\r\nIn these cases, API and sync code have more information what has changed and can be more efficient. If we expect users to call `joplin search --index`, I think many will just call that command \"just to be sure\" to avoid stale results. This is less efficient because if no data has changed, calling `joplin search --index` is just a waste?"

Calling indexing every time `joplin server` starts is not enough. API calls (POST/PUT/DELETE calls) can update notes after `joplin server` starts. I think we need the proposed `joplin search --index` to index new/updated/deleted notes again. Ideally, if API calls indexing after each update (POST/PUT/DELETE calls), it's more efficient. Don't need to index for read-only operations like `GET /notes` or `GET /search`.\r\n\r\n"

If scheduled items in the queue aren't being processed when the app is closed from the recent app list, then the title should remain \"before closing the app\".\r\n    - The relevant `AsyncActionQueue` is created here: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/0e1f6f48ef846f85430b29259dda8809218ef968/packages/app-mobile/components/screens/Note.tsx#L614\r\n- The note editor runs in a `WebView`, which transfers its updated content to `Note.tsx` when changed. If this issue is caused when the last editor content fails to transfer to `Note.tsx`, then the issue title should be changed to end with \"before closing the note\"."

This is because the change is not added to the save action queue until after the 100 ms, and the component would have been already unmounted.\r\n\r\nSo I think to fix this, in onMarkdownEditorTextChange the change needs to be made without using debounce, but instead push a slightly modified makeSaveAction which waits the 100ms before before executing it's logic. There is a risk though that if doing the delay in the action, that you can get a backlog of save action queue items because the queue runs synchronously. But maybe this could be worked around by instead of waiting 100ms explicitly, record a timestamp 100ms after the current time in the action when creating it, then only apply a delay if that time has not yet passed"

        "body": "Apologies, I jumped the gun a bit. After adding some additional logging and changing the code a bit, I can confirm that a note change scheduled using debounce does indeed execute, even after componentWillUnmount and the save action queue has completed. So that is not the issue.\r\nLooking at your old PR https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/10134 , if in some cases it takes several seconds to work through the backlog of the save action queue, then indeed the user may have exited the note and then exited the app as well within that time. As soon as the user exits the app, any background processing will stop, so any items left in the queue will be lost. I confirmed this by adding logging at the end of the componentWillUnmount method, setting a delay of 10 seconds and writing another log in the callback. If I exit the note so the first log entry is written, then exit the app using the back button before the 10 seconds is up, the second log entry never gets written. The componentWillUnmount method is asynchronous so the user will be back on the list view before the processing completes.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible with a React Native app to make some sort of visual indicator on the note screen while the note is saving, which persists onto the note list after exiting the note, until the save is completed? Or another option and maybe simpler would be to make the back button on the note (when switching from edit to to view mode) wait at intervals until the save action queue is empty, before executing the code to switch it to view mode. That way it will block the UI until all changes are saved"

        "body": "I made some further tests, and it turns out there are 3 issues:\n-**Last editor input is lost if the app is closed before all queued changes have been saved** - In manual testing of queued changes, I found that the 100 ms buffer between registering save actions greatly reduces the backlog and time required to execute it. As the the time to execute is unlikely to become significantly long, and large notes take a bit of time to render the note after exiting edit mode anyway, this is probably not that likely to occur providing that the user always exits the note before closing the app\n-**Last editor input is lost if the user exits a note within 100 ms after making changes, where consecutive changes were made** - I have attached a video below demonstrating this using the prebuilt Joplin 3.1.5 apk on Android emulator. The user would have to be super quick to make a change and exit both edit and view mode of the note for this occur, so again it's unlikely to happen. It's probably related to the fact that the note was unmounted before the change could be even finish rendering in view mode, so the state might not yet have been updated\n-**Last editor input is sometimes lost when exiting the note editor after making changes** - I have been able to fairly consistently reproduce this using the prebuilt Joplin 3.1.5 apk on Android emulator using a very large note by making text changes following pasting a chunk of text. I found that there is a specific error which appears in the logs during the period which I edit the note (which looks to align roughly with when I pasted the text) when the issue is reproduced. I've raised a new bug report with my findings for it https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/11317. This could possibly be the cause of the intermittent lost input issues which Joplin has had for a long time\nEDIT: This issue is now fixed in the 3.2.x releases\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84382c99-295e-4d47-8292-084e66292679\n"

For example it would have to be excluded from the note history feature and be treated in a special way in various places.`\n\nThere is a couple of suggestions on the thread for ways to support this at some level, though admittedly they are not so ideal solutions.\n\nIf you are purely concerned about other people seeing your screen while you search through your combined note collection, and not specifically concerned about additional access restrictions for your private notes, then you might consider to create a new profile in Joplin and move your private notes into that profile, and only switch to this profile when you are not in public."

It’s like a phone lock being pointless if files can still be accessed without unlocking the phone.\n\nBut I don’t care if this lock can actually stop people from cracking into my notes—I just want a UI lock on the folder.

If it does not, then trigger a failsafe error specifying that the sync target is empty or damaged. To avoid hitting this error when doing the initial sync on a device, bypass this error if the local database contains no items in the sync_items table matching the current sync target (then when it starts syncing it will create the info.json so that subsequent syncs should work without issue).\n\nIf the sync target is OneDrive, also destroy the existing authentication when hitting that specific failsafe error, to force the user to log into OneDrive again when they next press the sync button, in a hope that it will re-authenticate with the original 'special' folder."

I initially had rich-markdown additional classes, but after toggling them and rewriting my CSS, I still can't achieve the desired results. The only thing that worked was dimming the token.\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\nI’m reverting to the last stable version (3.0.15) because I rely heavily on these colors, and they function correctly there. The reason for trying the pre-release (3.1.17) was the new feature (from 3.1.16) to move notebooks without dragging, which is fantastic, but the updated CodeMirror (in the same 3.1.16) seems to have changed class names and structure significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need more information or which screenshots I can provide for clarity. I'm willing to reinstall the pre-release for further testing.\r\n\r\nIt's possible there are more classes impacted that they couldn't be tweaked anymore, I just gave up after trying with these three. \r\n\r\n#### in pre-release version 3.1.17\r\nBtw, these three work in pre-release in this form just fine, except that highlight lost token.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* **x** */\r\nspan.tok-strong.tok-meta { color: #353d6e !important}\r\nspan.tok-strong { color: #ff0040 !important; opacity: 1.0 !important }\r\n\r\n\r\n/* *x* */\r\nspan.tok-emphasis.tok-meta { color: #353d6e !important }\r\nspan.tok-emphasis { color: #ffe100 !important; opacity: 1.0 !important }\r\n\r\n/* ==x== */\r\nspan.cm-rm-highlight { background: #0B7447 !important; color: #eeeeee !important; opacity: 1.0 !important }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nFor headers to actually apply color changes (they only dimmed token). And not to lose information where are sublists / subquotes.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_"

Can I ask which combination you use, so that I can try to replicate your setup which seems to be able to run without having this issue?\n\nI would love to make it work, because I really love the concept of Joplin. It's the only application around which exactly gives me what I need while allowing me not to rely on external servers. It's really a shame because apart of this, it's such a great piece of software."

Hope my constructive feedback helps to improve Joplin by addressing such a serious concern:\n\nWhen completely **inactive** (no user interaction, no open notes, and running in the background), Joplin 3.3.12 (prod, darwin) on macOS 15.5 consumes about 1.5 GB of memory, as observed in the macOS Activity Monitor.\n\nThis includes:\n\n    - A “Joplin Helper (Renderer)” process using over 300 MB\n\n    - A GPU helper process consuming over 100 MB\n    \n    - Multiple other Renderer processes, each using about 75 MB\n\n<img width=\"396\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956f9da1-376f-4d89-9cdc-6a31d6a3c9ec\" />\n\n<img width=\"389\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05fd1d33-20f1-4223-922c-3600fef620bf\" />\n\nEven modern resource-intensive applications such as Chrome or Firefox with many open tabs and many plug-ins manage their idle memory footprint significantly better.\n\nThis is not only unexpected but also unacceptable for a note-taking application, especially when no activity is taking place.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWhen idle, Joplin should consume minimal memory, similar to other productivity tools. Background processes should be optimized, and memory use should reflect the app's current workload, which, in this case, is none.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that such RAM usage is extremely high even for many open documents for an app like Joplin. A thorough resolution to manage such resource intensiveness is crucial.\n\nThis appears to be a serious performance issue and possibly a memory leak or architectural inefficiency. Please consider prioritizing a fix in an upcoming release.\n\n\nThank you again for the hard work your team continues to put into Joplin. It’s an app with significant potential, and I hope to see this memory issue addressed soon.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_"

Joplin is just open in the background with no activity (zero open documents, and obviously, it does not support tabs), while Firefox is running with about 2,500 open tabs. For sure, not all tabs are active, but the point is that FF efficiently manages so many open tabs alongside many add-ons. Efficient, or at least a reasonable level of resource management, is the point that needs to be highlighted.\n\n\n<img width=\"1032\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8f201c5-5848-4ee8-b825-72d70b36bb3e\" />\n\n\n<img width=\"1036\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f4df5c8-70b2-44c4-8742-ac146ec2d6e0\" />\n\n\n\nJoplin consumes nearly as much memory as Firefox with over 2,000 tabs, despite doing nothing. It may suggest extremely poor memory efficiency. Such idle consumption seems abnormal and suggests a bug, memory leak, or architectural inefficiency.\n"

That dialog has been there for years, but I think you would normally never see it as it was part of legacy behaviour when the note editor had a save button. I'm guessing you only see the dialog in the case of a certain race condition - I think it may be if you press the edit button just after the note contents got changed, but before the note renders in edit mode (or possibly the other way, when you switch from edit to view mode via the hardware back button), via the moving note modification bug here"

I think that would work. Here's a list of considerations for this:\r\n- If an image is very large, we may not want to convert it to `data:image/png;base64`.\r\n- To avoid duplicating resource files, it might also be necessary to add a `data-resourceid` field to the `img` tag when copying.\r\n    - When copy/pasting between Joplin profiles, we'll need logic to make sure a non-existing resource isn't linked to. \r\n\r\n**Edit**: Adjusted formatting.\r\n\r\n"

        "body": "With the recent release of the capability to import ENEX/html I have imported a bunch of notes from Evernote. Ideally one would be able to create a copy of such a note in MD for further editing. In lieu of this, I tried to export an HTML note as MarkDown and re-import - assuming that this would do the conversion. However, it does not - the saved note is still html.\r\n\r\nThis is at least somewhat misleading, since I assumed that the export would do a format conversion, and it does not. Obviously my ideal case would be to have a note right-click on html notes to \"Duplicate as MD\" using the html->MD function already in Joplin :)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nJoplin version: 1.0.170\r\nPlatform: Linux\r\nOS specifics: ubuntu 18.04\r\n"

        "body": "When we OCR a PDF file we essentially make a screenshot of each page and process it. During the OCR process, Tesseract also provides coordinates to tell us where in the image the text should be, and we already save this information in the `ocr_details` column.\n\nUsing this information, we should recreate the PDF, and overlay the text on top of it. The PDF appearance needs to be identical to the original document, so it will be basically a file made of multiple screenshots. On top there should be an overlay, probably an invisible one. And it should be possible to select and copy and paste the text.\n\nThe aim is to make PDF files processed by Joplin more accessible. Some users have to deal with PDF documents that are essentially images which can't be read by screen reader tools. So by adding the actual text to it it should work.\n\nFor now, we can expose the feature with a right-click on the document with a menu item next to \"View OCR text\", for example \"Create accessible document\". It would take the PDF file, combine it with `ocr_details`, and output a new document.\n\nExample of document: [Arrete22pages.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20624513/Arrete22pages.pdf)"

This has been an ongoing problem since *last year* for me, finally decided to waste an afternoon to figure it out and came here to post about it.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that the mobile version of Joplin doesn't seem to experience this issue, only the desktop version. I also forgot to add: **I'm not using WebDAV, I'm using the Joplin-Server (Beta)**.\n\nEdit: If I put Joplin Server behind a TLS offloader instead of using plaintext then it will just timeout, even if just checking sync config. (To clarify, the connection is made, data is sent (based on size of packets), but nothing \"happens\" as a result.)\n\nFurther notes: I'm using a clean install of joplin-desktop (removed config folder, it's 100% 'default' with just the sync point changed to http://example.com (putting it behind a TLS offloader used to work until sometime last year, then it just times out while the client/server expects something?)). So I'm using the default \"Welcome to Joplin\" data and such."

In contrast to most other languages instead of having dedicated keys for our accented characters, they are accessed by pressing the option key (right alt on Windows) plus the letter. So, if I press Option+L I get ł, and pressing Shift+Option+L I get the uppercase Ł instead. At this point you can probably see the problem :)\n\nAfter updating to Joplin 3.3, the new link to note command takes priority and I can't type the Ł character. I reproduced this on both Mac and Windows. Thankfully, this was easy to fix on my end since you can reassign every keyboard shortcut, and that's what I did, but I think it would be a good idea if the default shortcut didn't conflict with this. If this helps, I ended up putting it on Cmd+Shift+K/CTRL+Shift+K on my Mac and Windows installations, which makes it similar to the existing command to add a link.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n_No response_\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_"

For me it just gave me additional peace of mind when clicking on it, since I knew it was a local link.\n\nI also understand that you do not want to add too many options and choose awesome defaults instead. But in this case it might be warranted.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, people who hate the icon could easily use CSS to get rid of it. Not sure if it is that easy to add it back with just CSS. (CSS doesn't know it's a local link, does it? I haven't checked whether different class names are used.) If it is easy, I don't have an issue to get the local link indicator back with CSS.\n\nI'm just saying that it would be a pitty, if a change robbed me of the option to get an indicator at all.\n\nP.S.: I am also more than ok with some other indicator, e.g. the dash underlines you suggested. I also do not really care whether it indicates local or external links, but I guess in most cases people would have more local links thus indicating external ones would be less intrusive. I am certainly not fixated on icons or what type of link is underscored (sorry for the pun). ;-) "

It's also very inconsistent when we display the icon or not - it doesn't show up in Markdown or Rich Text editor, but it does in Markdown viewer.\n\nWe should probably have a more subtle icon in any case but for now let's put an option then to disable it."

This would be a major inconvenience if I had to go to the first character of every list item and change it back to lowercase. Autocapitalization can be a real pain in the ass. Epecially if it is implemented poorly. I haven't looked into how Code Mirror does it, but I have seen bad implementations that made writing text extremly cumbersome. This is definitely one of the things that should be optional if you must really use it.\nJust my 2 cents."

(E.g. after clicking \"Header 5\", it seems unclear whether a header was added/removed and where).\n     - A [pull request](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11441) for this was closed (in part due to the complexity of how it got localization to work in the editor). Feedback on whether this should be implemented would be welcome!\n- [ ] **Screen reader**: Missing regions.\n    - **To-do**: Check whether it's possible to add `navigation`/`main`/... regions with React Native &mdash; the [supported accessibility `role`s](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#role) seem much more limited than what's available on web. This might be possible with an external dependency.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> For now, most of this evaluation focuses on mobile/Android. For keyboard accessibility (unless TalkBack is enabled), [React Native has focus issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/45801) with its built-in `TextInput` component.\n\n# Checklist\n\n\n## 1.1. Text alternatives\n\n### 1.1.1. [Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-content) (A)\n\n> All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.\n> - **Controls, Input**: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-name) that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)\n>  \\[ ...other exceptions... \\]\n> - **Decoration, Formatting, Invisible**: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.\n\n- [x] [❗] Sidebar dismiss button -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11056\n- [x] [❗] Settings: Switch, textboxes missing labels -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11358\n- [x] [❗] Attach file/sort by dialogs backdrop dismiss button -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11957\n\t- Related, but not resolved by: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11395\n- [x] [❗] Currently, the backdrop (which can be tapped to dismiss dialogs) isn't accessibility focusable and doesn't have a label for most dialogs  -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11957\n\t- In some cases, a separate close button is present in the UI (which does the same thing as tapping on the backdrop).\n- [x] [❗] Slider missing description -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11822\n\t- It doesn't seem to be possible to add a programmatic label to `@react-native-community/slider` (based on the [list of props in its README](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-slider) & an attempt to set `accessibilityHint`/`accessibilityLabeledBy`).\n- [x] [❗] Close button for note actions menu missing label -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11954\n\t- Fixing this may require patching/submitting a pull request to `react-native-popup-menu` ([related issue](https://github.com/instea/react-native-popup-menu/issues/138)).\n- [x] [❗] Label the \"add profile\" button -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11797\n\n### 1.2.1 - 1.2.3. Audio and Video (A)\n\n- [ ] [🔷] Prerecorded audio and video would be user-created (attached as files in notes). While users are currently able to provide their own audio/video transcripts, it may make sense to include an \"accessibility check\" button that checks for unlabelled audo/video/images. (I think OneNote has this).\n\n\n**Note**:  §1.2.4-1.2.9 are all related to audio/video recordings/streams, which is not included in Joplin mobile by default.\n\n\n### 1.3.1. [Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships) (A)\n\n> Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> \n> If it's not possible to convey certain relationships/structure with React Native, it may be permissible to describe the structure in text:\n> > Some technologies do not provide a means to programmatically determine some types of information and relationships. In that case then there should be a text description of the information and relationships. For instance, \"all required fields are marked with an asterisk (*)\". The text description should be near the information it is describing (when the page is linearized), such as in the parent element or in the adjacent element.\n> > — https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html\n\n- [ ] [❗] Use `accessibilityRole=\"heading\"` to identify headings.\n\t- [ ] \"Enable plugins\" screen headers.\n\t- [x] Headers on the sync status screen -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/12048 \n\t- [x] Header text in the toplevel navigation bar -- 5dfbb1883866f8d70793a988cee699c839f0542d\n\t- [x] Sidebar: Notebooks header -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11556\n- [x] [❗] Describe the \"select a notebook\" dropdown for accessibility -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11430\n- [x] [❗] Inform accessibility tools when notes are selected/unselected -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11424\n- [x] [❗] Expose the \"start selection mode\" longpress action to accessibility tools  -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11424\n- [x] [❗] Inform accessibility tools when Markdown toolbar items are selected -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11472\n- [ ] [❗] **iOS**: Describe relationship between number text inputs in settings and their labels.\n\t- [React Native's `accessibilityLabelledBy`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitylabelledby-android) is Android-only. However, it's still possible to use `accessibilityHint` to describe inputs to screen reader users.\n- [ ] [❗]  Use `accessibilityRole=\"search\"` on search fields (tags dialog search, global search, ...)\n- [ ] [🔎] Find other instances of missing accessibility information\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>\n> After adding/updating `accessbilityRole`s, be sure to check that the change improves screen reader accessibility on at least one platform and **doesn't degrade screen reader support** on other platforms.\n\nOther structure information:\n- [x] [❗] Fix checkbox not marked as checked on web (`accessibilityState` is ignored on web) -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11419\n\n### 1.3.2. [Meaningful sequence](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#meaningful-sequence) (A)\n\n> When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.\n\n**Note**: There are several issues related to this on iOS that [may be difficult to resolve without adding a new dependency](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/389). For example, \"dismiss\" actions are sometimes read while navigating menus. However, this document currently focuses on Android accessibility. Many of the iOS issues are not listed here.\n\n- [x] [❗] [🔎] New note menu: \"New note\"/\"New to-do\" buttons are before the \"New\" button in the focus order -- pressing \"New\" makes these items focusable, but it isn't necessarily clear that the user should navigate backwards in the focus order to access them. This may need to be changed.\n    - https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11780 adjusts the layout and design of the new note menu and may resolve this issue.\n\n### 1.3.3. [Sensory characteristics](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#sensory-characteristics) (A)\n\n> Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.\n\nThis guideline seems to apply to instructions for using the app. I'm not aware of mobile app instructions that rely on sensory characteristics. If they exist, however, they're most likely to be in settings screen descriptions.\n\n### 1.3.4. [Orientation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#orientation) (AA)\n\n> Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.\n\nAt least on Android, Joplin mobile does not restrict the screen orientation. In the past, however, on iOS, the `Modal` component's default `props` ([`supportedOrientations`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal#supportedorientations-ios)) have restricted the app orientation.\n\n### 1.3.5. [Identify input purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#identify-input-purpose) (AA)\n\n> The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when:\n> - The input field serves a purpose identified in the Input Purposes for User Interface Components section; and\n> - The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data.\n\n- [ ] [🔎] [🟡] This section seems to mostly be related to `autocomplete` in HTML. React Native has the [`autoComplete`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#autocomplete) attribute for `TextInput`. Most relevant is likely the `new-password` autocomplete value. Add correct `autoComplete` to inputs in settings.\n- [ ] [🟡] Ensure that search inputs are marked as search inputs (see also items under \"Info and Relationships\").\n\n\n**Note**: 1.3.6 is level AAA and not included in this document.\n\n\n## 1.4. Distinguishable\n\n### 1.4.1. [Use of color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#use-of-color) (A)\n\n> Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.\n\n**Note: Syntax highlighting**: Joplin's Markdown editor uses syntax highlighting to distinguish content. However, this syntax highlighting is based on the content of the document and should thus not be the \"only visual means of conveying information\".\n\n### 1.4.2. [Audio control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#audio-control) (A)\n\n> If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.\n\n\nAt present, all audio should be user-created (and only auto-play if this is set by the user in HTML). Additionally, audio included with `[](:/resourceidhere)` have WebView-provided controls.\n\n### 1.4.3. [Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#contrast-minimum) (Minimum) (AA)\n\n> The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:\n> - Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;\n> - Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.\n> - Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.\n\nContrast issues found with the accessibility scanner are listed in the section for SC 1.4.11.\n\n### 1.4.4. [Resize text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#resize-text) (AA)\n\n> Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.\n\n- [ ] [🔎] [🟡] Scale global text size independently of the OS.\n\t- **This might not be necessary**. Currently, it's possible to resize Joplin's text size using \"text scale\" in system settings. A sufficient technique is \"[using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G142.html)\". Is this sufficient? (Does Joplin need to be able to zoom independently of the OS?)\n\nIf relying on the system zoom level is not sufficient,\n- Joplin already supports setting the editor font size.\n- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11633 added support setting the note viewer font size.\n\n### 1.4.5. [Images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#images-of-text) (AA)\n\n> If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for the following: \n\nAside from icons (which should have labels and are often non-text), Joplin does not use images of text.\n\n### 1.4.6. - 1.4.9.\n\nSCs 1.4.6-1.4.9 are all level AAA and have been omitted.\n\n### 1.4.10. [Content reflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow) (AA)\n> Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:\n> - Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;\n    Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.\n> - Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.\n\n\n- [x] [🟡] Fix parts of certain dialogs are clipped offscreen on screens with height 256px -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11395\n- [ ] [🟡] The notebook list cannot be accessed on a screen with height 256px.\n- [ ] [🟡] The Markdown toolbar is always hidden on screens with a small height (near 256px).\n   - Showing the toolbar in this case would make it very difficult to use the note editor. It may make sense to instead allow toggling the toolbar, note title input, and/or action bar on small screens. This would allow all of these controls to be accessed without also hiding most of the editor.\n\n### 1.4.11. [Non-text contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-contrast) (AA)\n\n> The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):\n> - **User Interface Components**\n    Visual information required to identify user interface components and states, except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author;\n> - **Graphical Objects**\n>   Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed.\n\nThe below are based on the default light mode theme.\n- [ ] [🟡] \"Error\" and \"Beta\" buttons for plugins\n- [x] [🟡] Contrast of faded URLs in the Markdown editor -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11635\n- [ ] [🟡] Contrast of content in blockquotes.\n\n### 1.4.12. [Text spacing](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#text-spacing) (AA)\n\n> In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:\n>\n> -   Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;\n> -   Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;\n> -   Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;\n> -   Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.\n\n- [🟡] [🔎] I don't think Android supports changing these by default. However, this should be double-checked.\n\t- [🔎] This document doesn't focus on the web app, but it may make sense to check this for the web app as well.\n\n### 1.4.13. [Content hover on focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#content-on-hover-or-focus) (AA)\n\n> Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:\n> \n> - **Dismissible**\n    A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content;\n> - **Hoverable**\n    If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;\n> - **Persistent**\n    The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.\n>\n> Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.\n\n- [ ] [🟡] (🖋️) Drawing tool: Allow hovering over toolbar hint text (\"hoverable\").\n- [ ] [🟡] (🖋️) Drawing tool: Make hint text satisfy **persistent** when navigating with the keyboard (unless dismissed with \"esc\").\n\n**Note**: Tooltips on mobile are triggered by long-press and currently are **not** triggered by the keyboard. When this changes to satisfy 2.1.1, it should be ensured that the new shortcuts satisfy this SC.\n\n## 2.1. Keyboard accessible\n> Make all functionality available from a keyboard.\n\n- [ ] [🔎] Check whether keyboard accessibility **while a screen reader is enabled** is sufficient. React Native [has at least one issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/45801) that may make implementing full keyboard accessibility difficult. Additionally, it's unclear whether React Native exposes keyboard focus events on Android (may be needed for tooltip keyboard accessibility). Alternatively, we could focus on making the web version of the mobile app keyboard accessible.\n\t- For now, the keyboard accessibility sections focus on **screen reader keyboard accessibility**, which works differently from standard keyboard accessibility. \n\n### 2.1.1.

[Bypass blocks](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bypass-blocks) (A)\n> A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple web pages.\n\n- [ ] [❗] [🔎] The screen header component is repeated on multiple pages. Check that:\n\t- If, when navigating to a screen, focus is placed before the screen header, it's easy to <kbd>tab</kbd> to the main content.\n\t- **OR**: The screen header content doesn't count as \"repeated\" (since the header is different on different pages).\n\n### 2.4.2. [Page titled](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#page-titled) (A)\n> Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.\n\nThe SC includes the following  note:\n> In cases such as Single Page Applications (SPAs), where various distinct pages/views are all nominally served from the same URI and the content of the page is changed dynamically, the title of the page should also be changed dynamically to reflect the content or topic of the current view.\n\n- [ ] [❗] [🔎] What is the equivalent for a page title in Android? Can we change it dynamically (should we?).\n\nAlso, on web:\n- [ ] Dynamically change the title of the page to match the current note and/or screen.\n\n### 2.4.3. [Focus order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-order) (A)\n> If a web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.\n\nJoplin on mobile does not (as far as I'm aware) override focus order. However, this SC also discusses **modal dialogs** in its description. As such, (by [F85](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F85))\n- [x] [❗] Voice typing dialog: Jump focus to the header when it opens -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11428\n\t- [ ] [❗] [🔎] Check that focus is moved to a place that makes sense when closing the voice typing dialog.\n- [x] [❗] Move and restore focus for menu dialogs -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11395\n- [x] [❗] Move accessibility focus to the first note actions menu menu item when opened -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11031\n- [x] [❗] Fix focus jumps to the start of the document when opening/closing Markdown toolbar overflow -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11472\n- [x] [❗] **iOS**: Focus order leaves, then re-enters note actions menu before visiting all items -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11929\n- [x] [❗] Focus doesn't move to plugin dialogs (panels are okay) -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11929\n- [x] [❗] Difficult to move focus to plugin dialogs -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11929\n- [ ] [❗] **iOS**: Focus is not restored to the initial location when closing dialogs.

[Link purpose (in context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#link-purpose-in-context) (A)\n> The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programatically-determined context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.\n\nThe WCAG 2.2 defines \"link purpose\" as the \"nature of the result obtained by activating a hyperlink\". The mobile app uses few true hyperlinks. However, SC 2.4.6. seems to cover this case.\n\n**App controls/state**: The hyperlinks in \"more information\" **do** currently describe their target in the content of the link (e.g. \"Make a donation\" with role \"link\"). \n\n**Welcome notes**: The welcome notes include a link with just the text \"link\", but it's included within a descriptive paragraph.\n\n### 2.4.5. [Multiple ways](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#multiple-ways) (AA)\n> More than one way is available to locate a web page within a set of web pages except where the web page is the result of, or a step in, a process.\n\n**Note**: The WCAG 2.2 spec defines \"web page\" as \"a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that reused in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent.\" As such, this doesn't seem to apply to Joplin mobile.\n\nIf this **does** apply to Joplin mobile,\n- **Settings**: Joplin mobile's settings support accessing settings via search and through the sidebar tabs.\n- **Notes**: Notes can be accessed through search or by accessing their parent notebooks.\n\n### 2.4.6. [Headings and labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#headings-and-labels) (AA)\n> Headings and labels describe topic or purpose.\n\n**Note**: SC 1.3.1/4.1.2 are similar to this success criterion, but is about whether labels are present or not (rather than their content).\n\n- [ ] [🟡] Improve labels for the \"recommended plugin\" button. Currently, it's difficult to tell *which* plugin the button belongs to. See the labels on \"About\" and \"Install\" for an example of a possible solution.\n- [x] [🟡] Select notebook dropdown has an unclear label -- #11430.\n- [x] [🟡] Sort notes by dialog doesn't state whether items are checked/unchecked (e.g. whether currently sorting by updated date). -- #11411\n\n### 2.4.7. [Focus visible](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-visible) (AA)\n> Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.\n\n- [ ] [🟡] **Android**: There are a large number of invisible (screen reader and visually hidden) components that do get focus when using a hardware keyboard. For example,\n\t- The sidebar is marked as `inert` and hidden for accessibility, but still gets keyboard focus.\n\t- The same is true for the invisible tooltip placeholders between buttons in the Markdown editor toolbar.\n\n### 2.4.9-2.4.10 (AAA)\n\n**Skipped**: SC 2.4.9-2.4.10 are level AAA.\n\n### 2.4.11. [Focus not obscured (minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#focus-not-obscured-minimum) (AA)\n> When a user interface component receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.\n\n- [ ] [🟡] **Android/keyboard only**: When navigating with <kbd>tab</kbd> (does not apply to screen reader nav with <kbd>alt</kbd>-arrow keys or swipe):\n\t- Focus can enter the (hidden) notes list.\n\t- Focus can enter the (hidden) sidebar.\n- [x] [🟡] **Android/screen reader**:\n\t- [x] Prevent focus in the sidebar while it's closed -- #11056\n\t- [x] Prevent just-opened dialogs from obscuring focus -- #11395\n- [x] [🟡] **Screen reader+Android,Keyboard+Android,Web,iOS**: It's possible to move keyboard and accessibility focus behind the note actions menu while it's open -- https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/11929\n\t- Fixing this may require switching to a different library for the note actions menu.\n\n### 2.4.12-2.4.13 (AAA)\n\n**Skipped**: SC 2.4.12-2.4.13 are level AAA.\n\n## 2.5. Input modalities\n> Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.\n\n### 2.5.1. [Pointer gestures](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pointer-gestures) (A)\n> All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Definition:\n> > A path-based gesture involves an interaction where not just the endpoints matter, but how the pointer moves between these points.\n\n- **Drawing**: Rectangles and lines depend only on the start/end points (so are not a \"path-based gesture\"). Zooming is possible both with pinch-zoom and buttons in the \"hand\" tool menu (also with keyshortcuts).\n\n### 2.5.2. [Pointer cancellation](https://w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pointer-cancellation) (A)\n> For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:\n>\n> - **No Down-Event**: The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;\n> - **Abort or Undo**: Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;\n> - **Up Reversal**: The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;\n> - **Essential**: Completing the function on the down-event is essential.\n\n- **Drawing**: Most actions can be undone with the \"undo\" button. For selection, touching the screen with a second finger converts the \"select\" action to a \"zoom\" action, which should satisfy \"Abort or Undo\".  However, this requires a second pointer.\n\t- [ ] [❗] (🖋️) Add a way to restore the selection to whatever it was previously, without requiring a second pointer. I'm not sure what the UI for this will look like.\n\t\t- Perhaps returning the pointer to its starting point should cancel changing the selection? I don't think this makes sense for lasso selection, though...\n\t- [ ] [❗] [🔎] (🖋️) Add a way to restore the viewport to its previous location. The current logic of returning the pointer to its original location *may* be sufficient here.\n- **Dialogs**:\n\t- [ ] [❗] (🖋️) Touching outside, then dragging inside a dialog causes the dialog to be dismissed. (Tested on iOS).\n \n### 2.5.3. [Label in name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#label-in-name) (A)\n> For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually.\n\nThis [doesn't seem to apply to symbolic text characters](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/label-in-name.html#intent) (e.g. the \"bold\" button in the toolbar).\n\n### 2.5.4. [Motion actuation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#motion-actuation) (A)\n> Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:\n\n**Note**: Includes an \"essential\" exception.\n\n- **Camera**: Essential\n\n### 2.5.5 - 2.5.6\n\nThese sections are level AAA and skipped.\n\n### 2.5.7. [Dragging movements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dragging-movements) (AA)\n> All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential or the functionality is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.\n\n- [ ] [🟡] Horizontal scrolling on the toolbar -- add buttons to scroll left/right.\n\t- This might not be necessary — what counts as \"determined by the user agent\" in this case? See [discussion](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/522#issuecomment-2009842227).\n\t- The \"understanding\" page does include \"This criterion does not apply to scrolling enabled by the user-agent.\"\n- [ ] [🟡] (🖋️) **Drawing**: Add a way to create shapes with only a single pointer.\n\t- Check how other apps do this. One option might be to make a \"click\" gesture add shapes when using a shape tool. However, it might be difficult to determine whether a user intends to click or draw.\n\n### 2.5.8. [Target size](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#target-size-minimum) (minimum)\n> The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels, except where:\n> \n> - **Spacing:** Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the bounding box of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target;\n> - **Equivalent:** The function can be achieved through a different control on the same page that meets this criterion;\n> - **Inline:** The target is in a sentence or its size is otherwise constrained by the line-height of non-target text;\n> - **User agent control:** The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author;\n> - **Essential:** A particular presentation of the target is essential or is legally required for the information being conveyed.\n\n- The accessibility scanner marks a few touch targets (that seem to be actual touch targets) as smaller than 48x48 px, but these are all above 24x24 px.\n\n## 3.1.

        "body": "> Uncategorized/external keyboard: TextInput blocks focus (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/45801)\n\nRegarding this point, I gave it a go adding the https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-external-keyboard dependency and replacing the usage of the TextInput component to be a KeyboardExtendedInput component. Out of the box this change alone does fix the issue on Android (I have not tested on IOS) so that you can tab or use the arrow keys on an external keyboard to switch between all the settings options without getting blocked by the TextInput - I also tested it with Talkback and it correctly reads the value. Note that the styling of the TextInput does require a bit of tinkering though to match the existing styling for a TextInput, as by default the width of the input contracts to the size of the input value instead of being fixed. Also note that when the KeyboardExtendedInput is in focus via the tab or arrows keys, you have to press the space bar first, in order to allow changing the value. If you press the field with your finger or mouse click though, it will immediately be in edit mode and you can start typing the value.\n\nAlso there looks to be an additional accessibility issue when using an external keyboard. You can open up a dropdown field by pressing enter when it is in focus, however it is not possible to change the selected value in the dropdown using an external keyboard, as far as I can tell, as the dropdown items are no selectable with the arrow keys.\nEDIT: Actually, this is not an issue. You can select a drop down item if you get the dropdown in focus, press enter, and then press tab, which then allows you to select an option using the arrow keys. Though sometimes you have to press tab twice in order to get the dropdown items to be in focus\n\nFYI this is just for informational purposes. I don't think I will be investing further effort to implement these changes for a PR."

From [an upstream commit message](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3420eb87b01f42092c1691a1f6544f20d244cc60):\n\n> This is breaking keyboard navigation. Pressing tab or arrow keys will no-op if the next destination is a `TextInput`. This is because Android will call `requestFocus` from [here](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/base/core/java/android/view/ViewRootImpl.java;l=7868?q=performFocusNavigation) when handling key events. Notably, Explore By Touch (TalkBack) swiping gestures WOULD focus `TextInputs` since they go through `ExploreByTouchHelper` methods which we override to call the proper `requestFocusInternal()` method.\n\nBased on this, upgrading to React Native >= 0.79 may fix the issue."

Otherwise most apps have an option to paste without formatting\n\nThe problem with paste without formatting is that you lose all of the text formatting (not just the background color)\n\nIMO in most cases it would be ideal if it would copy just the semantic text formatting (bold, italitcs, formatted lists, etc...), but not any theme styling (background color, font color, font/font size, etc...). \n\nFor example, similar to Typora's \"Copy without theme styling\" option (https://support.typora.io/Copy-and-Paste/), though I suppose that's more of a feature request than a bug\n\n"
